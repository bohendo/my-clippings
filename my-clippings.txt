A company’s balance sheet shows its financial position at a given point in time. Balance sheets are formatted in accordance with the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity Current assets are those that are expected to be converted into cash within 12 months or less. Any asset that is not a current asset is a non-current (a.k.a. long-term) asset by default. Current liabilities are those that will need to be paid off within the next 12 months. By default, any liability that is not a current liability is a long-term liability.

The income statement shows a company’s financial performance over a period of time (usually a year). A company’s gross profit is equal to its revenues minus its Cost of Goods Sold. A company’s operating income is equal to its gross profit minus its operating expenses—the expenses that have to do with the core operation of the business. A company’s net income is equal to all of its revenues and gains, minus all of its expenses and losses.

The statement of retained earnings details the changes in a company’s retained earnings over a period of time. The statement of retained earnings acts as a bridge between the income statement and the balance sheet. It takes information from the income statement, and it provides information to the balance sheet. Dividend payments are not an expense. They are a distribution of profits. Retained earnings is not the same as cash. Often, a significant portion of a company’s retained earnings is spent on attempts to grow the company.

The accounting equation states that at all times, and without exceptions, the following will be true: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity So what does that mean? Let’s take a look at the equation piece by piece. Assets: All of the property owned by the company. Liabilities: All of the debts that the company currently has outstanding to lenders. Owners’ Equity (a.k.a. Shareholders’ Equity): The company’s ownership interest in its assets, after all debts have been repaid.

A company’s assets consist of all the property that the company owns.  A company’s liabilities consist of all the debt that the company owes to lenders.  A company’s owners’ equity is equal to the owners’ interest in the company’s assets, after paying back all the company’s debts.  The accounting equation is always written as follows: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity  However, it’s likely easier to think of the accounting equation this way: Assets – Liabilities = Owners’ Equity.

Consider the Ayn Rand phenomenon: her books Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead have been read for more than half a century by millions of people, in spite of, or most likely thanks to, brutally nasty reviews and attempts to discredit her.

For instance, having an intense emotional shock from seeing a snake coming out of my keyboard or a vampire entering my room, followed by a period of soothing safety (with chamomile tea and baroque music) long enough for me to regain control of my emotions, would be beneficial for my health, provided of course that I manage to overcome the snake or vampire after an arduous, hopefully heroic fight and have a picture taken next to the dead predator. Such a stressor would be certainly better than the mild but continuous stress of a boss, mortgage, tax problems, guilt over procrastinating with one’s tax return, exam pressures, chores, emails to answer, forms to complete, daily commutes—things that make you feel trapped in life. In other words, the pressures brought about by civilization. In fact, neurobiologists show that the former type of stressor is necessary, the second harmful, for one’s health.

So antifragility gets a bit more intricate—and more interesting—in the presence of layers and hierarchies. A natural organism is not a single, final unit; it is composed of subunits and itself may be the subunit of some larger collective. These subunits may be contending with each other. Take another business example. Restaurants are fragile; they compete with each other, but the collective of local restaurants is antifragile for that very reason.

These types often consider themselves the “victims” of some large plot, a bad boss, or bad weather. Finally, a thought. He who has never sinned is less reliable than he who has only sinned once.

Their respective industries improve from failure to failure. Natural and naturelike systems want some overconfidence on the part of individual economic agents, i.e., the overestimation of their chances of success and underestimation of the risks of failure in their businesses, provided their failure does not impact others. In other words, they want local, but not global, overconfidence.

Now, by disrupting the model, as we will see, with bailouts, governments typically favor a certain class of firms that are large enough to require being saved in order to avoid contagion to other business. This is the opposite of healthy risk-taking; it is transferring fragility from the collective to the unfit. People have difficulty realizing that the solution is building a system in which nobody’s fall can drag others down—for continuous failures work to preserve the system. Paradoxically, many government interventions and social policies end up hurting the weak and consolidating the established.

Hormesis, a word coined by pharmacologists, is when a small dose of a harmful substance is actually beneficial for the organism, acting as medicine. A little bit of an otherwise offending substance, not too much, acts to benefit the organism and make it better overall as it triggers some overreaction. This was not interpreted at the time in the sense of “gains from harm” so much as “harm is dose dependent” or “medicine is dose dependent.”

risk management professionals look in the past for information on the so-called worst-case scenario and use it to estimate future risks—this method is called “stress testing.” They take the worst historical recession, the worst war, the worst historical move in interest rates, or the worst point in unemployment as an exact estimate for the worst future outcome. But they never notice the following inconsistency: this so-called worst-case event, when it happened, exceeded the worst case at the time. I have called this mental defect the Lucretius problem, after the Latin poetic philosopher who wrote that the fool believes that the tallest mountain in the world will be equal to the tallest one he has observed.

Lenny Cake was the most physically intimidating person within five zip codes, and he was sixty. So, rather than taking lessons, I watched him train. He was into the “maximum lifts” type of training and swore by it, as he found it the most effective and least time-consuming. This method consisted of short episodes in the gym in which one focused solely on improving one’s past maximum in a single lift, the heaviest weight one could haul, sort of the high-water mark. The workout was limited to trying to exceed that mark once or twice, rather than spending time on un-entertaining time-consuming repetitions

I asked why I should feel it there, and my doctor friend came up with the answer that the biceps’ job is not only to lift the forearm up to flex but also to turn the wrist. If the biceps’ job is to turn the wrist, I wondered why I shouldn’t make it more difficult to turn the dumbbell. So I made one side of my dumbbells heavier, throwing them out of balance, and instantly I could feel what it did for my biceps.

The most important thing is that my mind was always in touch with my body; I felt my muscles continuously; I always took an inventory before working out. I flexed my muscles and got in touch. That not only helped me train; it was like meditating. I locked my mind into my muscle during training, as if I’d transplanted my mind into the tissue itself. By just thinking about it, I could actually send blood into a muscle. I formalized it by regularly making an inventory. How does my body feel now? I would ask myself. How does my chest feel? What did I get out of this press behind the neck, doing ten repetitions instead of five repetitions? How are my triceps? It doesn’t do any good to go through training like a blind man, to just go through the motions. Motions mean nothing. You have to realize what is happening to you.

I questioned myself: Why you, Arnold? How did you win Mr. Universe after only five years of training? Other people asked me the same question. I began looking at the difference between me and other bodybuilders. The biggest difference was that most bodybuilders did not think I’m going to be a winner. They never allowed themselves to think in those terms. I would hear them complaining while they were training, “Oh, no, not another set!” The negative impulses around a gym can be incredible.

If a man stands there and thinks for one-tenth of a second, “Maybe I can’t lift it,” it’s gone. He will not make the lift. Proof of my point is that for years weight lifters could not lift more than 500 pounds. Nobody could. They did 4991/2 but never 500. The reason was this supposedly insurmountable mental barrier that had existed for years. They stood in front of the weight thinking, “No one has ever lifted 500 pounds. Why should I be the one?” Then in 1970 Alexiev of Russia lifted 501 pounds. He broke the barrier. A month after that, three or four guys lifted 500 pounds.

You must consider that in the beginning you are training the mind as well as the body. The mind, after all, makes you want to train; it turns on the body.

The result of exercising too soon will be poor digestion of your food. I advise never to train immediately before a meal or right after one. In either case it’s bad.

such status-and-conflict games are generally time-wasters (though you should learn to play them because you can be forced into them by external factors). Wherever possible, you should attempt to move the conversation to an open one that is about generating or exchanging information, or disengage if that turns out to be impossible

the key is to acknowledge and bracket emotions and consciously let them go. Some emotions are easier to handle this way than others, such as anger and pride. Others are harder: an emotion might have no name, and manifest very weakly as a slight tension in your lower back. The only way you can process is to become aware of it and let it go, even if you don’t understand where it came from or what it represents

Violence is a necessary consequence of unavoidable ignorance on the part of systems that lack infinite wisdom. You cannot avoid it, or enlighten yourself out of it.  But for a long time I wasn’t able to translate this into a form more usable in everyday interactions. Only recently did I come up with an articulation that I sort of liked: The ideas of your friends are not always the friends of your ideas.  What does this mean? It means that even when two mindful and egoless individuals have adequately let go of emotions relating to buried, irrelevant, intrinsic motivations, and are dealing with the relevant facts and extrinsic motivations in sophisticated ways, and properly identifying and reacting appropriately to areas of ignorance, you will still have conflict.

When a friendship can stand the test of sometimes-diverging, sometimes-converging pursuit of individual ideas, it acquires great depth. Relationships based on false harmony and denial of ideas, or worse, one party cravenly abandoning their own ideas in the interests of preserving the relationship, are fundamentally weak, and not worth very much.

Here’s an example. Suppose you’ve put in eleven months of work into building a piece of software. You have one month left to finish when you suddenly discover a fantastic open-source equivalent that you can work on tweaking for two weeks, and produce a better outcome than if you persevered and finished your own design. At this point, the fact of you having put in eleven months worth of hard work is basically irrelevant. You’ll deliver a better outcome faster if you were to just throw away your own work and use the open-source equivalent. And that’s the path

In the software example, let’s say two people were involved, you and a friend. If you are slightly evil, while your partner is heavily attached to closure and “finishing,” he may try very hard to make up rationalizations between your objective-weighted story and his subjective-weighted one (“we can’t use that open source thing; we haven’t tested it enough...”). If you make the sunk-costs-indifferent decision anyway, he may resent you and cause problems down the road.  To the slightly evil, the answer is simple. Do the future real costs of the resentment for you outweigh the benefit of making the sunk-costs-indifferent decision? If so, it is worth humoring your colleague. If not, make the sunk-costs indifferent decisions and deal with the fallout.

So the slightly evil lesson is this: to the extent that the society you are in is tribal, being vindictive and indulging in vendettas is rational in objective terms. To the extent that the society around you is civilized, these behaviors will backfire. Revenge on the other hand is never objectively worthwhile, whether the society is tribal or civilized. This is rather ironic, since it is actually revenge that takes the most intelligence and rational planning.

If you suspend judgement and immediately start looking around to actually figure out what happened, you are assuming nothing. This is the apparently rational, data-driven way to proceed. In contexts where winning matters (honking matches on the road aren’t among them), it is also a way to lose.  The problem with the apparently rational response is that such situations are often fast-moving and ambiguous, and it is hard to tell who was in the wrong. Often there is shared blame as well as a role played by bad luck. If you don’t act immediately, your rational analysis will not matter. Inaction is loss.

Getting even is the key phrase here. Vindictiveness is a status-leveling move. If somebody hurts you, it doesn’t matter what the reasons and backstory are. If you don’t hurt them back, you’ve lost status points.  So the intensity of an vindictive reaction is usually proportionate to the perceived status loss, not to the actual material loss in the situation.

This also explains why (again, in tribal societies) it is rational to push back harder than you were pushed. You prefer a decisive outcome to the shoving/pushing/shouting contest for three reasons, especially if there are witnesses. First, you should visibly exact a penalty for the opponent starting an unjustified conflict. Second, the opponent knows personally not to mess with you again, out of real fear of hurt. And third, if he does spread his own version of the story, even if he convinces his friends that he was morally right, you actually get PR for your not-to-be-messed-with reputation, because you won the actual fight.

Even if you know you were wrong, if you ALSO know the other person cannot possibly know that, it pays to take offense and push back.  Why?  Because accepting blame without proof (i.e., needlessly admitting guilt) legitimizes the other person’s authority to act as judge, jury and executioner without proof.

A vendetta is not a revenge. There isn’t a whole lot of deliberation, planning or subterfuge. In fact those tend to make for ineffective vendettas, because the point of every move and counter-move in a vendetta is to demonstrate raw power and making a “not guilty” case in the court of public opinion. The point is not to demonstrate intelligence. In fact, it pays to make your vendetta move as visibly close to the original as possible. If they killed one of your sons, you kill one (or two) of their sons. Complicating the story with clever moves makes it much harder to read socially,

To the extent that an extended conflict is playing out in the same tribal context (such as a corporate department), where reputations matter, and to the extent that individual players are legible (i.e. you are not railing against a system to which you are imputing tribal motives), calibrated vindictive behavior is valuable.  To put it in the context of the most familiar battleground for most of us, if you do not push back when pushed in the office, you will have people walking all over you. A nominal organizational peer attempting to assert authority over you by “delegating” work to you over email requires immediate pushback to establish the right status relationship. Possibly with a cc to the joint manager. And yes, this does create a problem for the manager to deal with. That’s his/her job: to civilize the essentially tribal interaction for the greater good.

I find it very useful to think in terms of a hierarchy of deception skills, from the least sophisticated to the most sophisticated. The less sophisticated ones are harder to justify than the more sophisticated ones, which is reason enough to increase your sophistication level.  The least sophisticated form of deception is outright lying and fabrication of evidence.  A slightly more sophisticated form of deception is misdirection. You don’t lie, but you foreground a pattern of true information that is likely to lead to false conclusions.  Next you get withholding of information. You don’t lie or misdirect, but you don’t necessarily share any information that you don’t have to.  Next, you get equivocation, or sharing of information in ambiguous ways. This allows you to maintain plausible deniability against charges of lying, misdirection or withholding information, and relies on the predisposition of the other party to draw certain conclusions over others.  At the final level of sophistication, you get not-correcting-others. You don’t lie, misdirect, withhold or equivocate. But when others are drawing false conclusions that you could correct if you chose to (or missing inferences that are obvious to you due to your greater skill), you selectively choose not to help them out.

But in the unscripted part of the world of work that free agents inhabit, there are far fewer behaviors to imitate, no well-tested scripts, and few social cues helping you calibrate success/failure and suggesting appropriate behaviors. If you’re actually failing (failing to make rent for example), the problem is quite simple. At some point you’ll run out of money no matter how low your burn rate, and end up having to head back to the scripted world or spiral down into a homeless shelter.  The problem is with success. You have enough to continue indefinitely, with a little discretionary surplus that allows you to think beyond the next rent check. And that’s where the trouble starts.  You’re not quite sure how to calibrate your response to your evolving situation.

Even radical success doesn’t make this lack of narrative structure go away. When things are absolutely booming, you have to face the terror of the thought that it may be a transient success that could vanish as quickly as it appeared. The question then becomes, this is too good to last; am I making enough hay while the sun is shining? Or, where can I safely put this cash I am spinning right now?  So what do you do? The key to the answer is one word: insurance. Insurance is the idea that drives script building and behaviors for those who lack a script to deal with the rewards of success.

The problem here with K is that she forgot the first rule of dueling: as the challenged party, you need to exercise your prerogative to choose the time, place and manner of combat. That is the great advantage in being the reactor rather than the instigator. Don’t choose a drunken fist-fight in a bar simply because that’s where the challenge was thrown down.

Here’s the effective method: you need to interrupt as soon as you’ve roughly understood that there is an objectionable point being made (which can be before the speaker has finished making it), and before you’ve decided what to say. You do so by thinking out aloud, going “Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh!” or “Ehhhhummmmmm!” clearly, and stretching out your interrupt phrase over several seconds, until the interruptee shuts up and looks towards you. And most importantly, it should be patently clear that you haven’t yet decided what to say, and are thinking about it.

Wrangling luck by influencing how serendipity and zemblanity slosh around is the same as wrangling VUCA.  While a lot of VUCA emerges in the physical environment, in competitive settings, much of it originates in people, in the social layer of gameplay itself. So in the context of interpersonal interactions, VUCA means the following:  Volatility: there are no pure friends or enemies; most players you interact with are likely to be allies today, adversaries tomorrow and neutrals the day after.  Uncertainty: it is hard to tell potential allies and adversaries apart at a fundamental level, because situations and optimal patterns of loyalty are fundamentally murky..  Complexity: Ever tried to diagram the set of who-hates-whom/who-likes-whom in the organization chart of a corporation? Intractable beyond about a dozen.  Ambiguity: The environment is what it is. Ambiguity is a feature of your mental model of it, characterized by ifs, buts and maybes in your thinking about a situation.

One good heuristic is to ask: after an encounter that you “win” in some sense, does the other person feel like they learned something valuable at a reasonable price or that they were played for a sucker, or paid too high a cost for the learning?  This only works if you haven’t already dehumanized the person in your own mind. One way to test for rationalization via dehumanization is to ask: would you want to win that way against a spouse, friend, child, pet or parent?

I do perceive people who behave in uncivil ways, or create disharmony through inconsiderate behavior, as being morally objectionable, not just a practical nuisance to deal with.

This causes a fork in the blockchain, with miners and users who did not upgrade to the new version existing on a separate chain from those who upgraded.

Investors are people with more money than time.       Employees are people with more time than money.       Entrepreneurs are simply the seductive go-betweens.       Startups are business experiments performed with other people’s money.       Marketing is like sex: only losers pay for it.       Company culture is what goes without saying.       There are no real rules, only laws.       Success forgives all sins.       People who leak to you, leak about you.       Meritocracy is the propaganda we use to bless the charade.       Greed and vanity are the twin engines of bourgeois society.       Most managers are incompetent and maintain their jobs via inertia and politics.       Lawsuits are merely expensive feints in a well-scripted conflict narrative between corporate entities.       Capitalism is an amoral farce in which every player—investor, employee, entrepreneur, consumer—is complicit.

The most important decision in a startup, as in life, is picking a partner. It will determine everything that comes after. With the right team, no man or organization can stand against you, and you will ultimately triumph. With the wrong team, you’ll produce internal problems even faster than the external world can, and your inevitable death will effectively be a suicide.

Here was a woman who excelled in the role of gatekeeper and shepherd to difficult and powerful men, whether that role was chief of staff for the prickly US treasury secretary Larry Summers, or COO of and for Zuck. Between her ability to navigate and manage the mercurial and fractious political landscape of a complex organization like Facebook, and her ability to shape messages for Zuck, she was both de facto and de jure the person who ran Facebook Ads. As the debate about the future of Facebook monetization grew more polarized and heated, these meetings would resemble the Supreme Court of Sheryl, the one place where conflicting views could be aired with some hope of resolution.

An investor writes you a check for $100,000 to get the startup going. A year later, after hitting some product or usage milestones, you raise $1 million on a $10 million valuation (your typical postseed funding round, referred to as a “series A”). That debt—the original $100,000—converts into equity in the company. Given that the valuation is $10 million, and the investor put in $100,000, he now owns 1 percent of the company. From the point of the view of the investor, this is actually problematic. Say you’re the hot startup of the moment in the midst of a bubble, and you raise on some crazy valuation, such as $100 million. Well, pity our poor angel investor; he gets only 0.1 percent of the company. In essence, the better the company does, the less of it he gets. While he’s guaranteed (in theory) to get a price per share equal to follow-on investors, that’s actually a gross mispricing of his risk, as he put his money in far earlier, when the company was far riskier. Enter the investor’s great friend: the cap. The cap dictates the maximum number at which the company will be valued, for the purposes of calculating the investor’s stake when the company takes more investment capital. In our previous example, say the initial $100,000 investment had been done at a cap of $3 million. Then, despite the company’s raising later at a valuation of $10 million, the angel’s stake amounts to $100,000 ÷ $3 million = 3.3%, a much bigger slice.

Funding a company via equity, rather than debt, is a different beast. With a capped note, there’s no universal agreed-upon value. You can bounce from investor to investor, like a bee from flower to flower gathering pollen, getting notes signed at various caps, and no one need be the wiser. In priced-equity rounds, however, everyone has to agree on a share price and a total amount sold, and everyone must sign on the dotted line at once.

“Tombstones” are the chintzy engraved Lucite bricks used to commemorate a deal in high-stakes American corporate life. On Wall Street, they mark the syndication of some stock or bond deal (an IPO or a bond issue, for example) and decorate, with varying degrees of derision or seriousness, many an investment banker’s desk. In Silicon Valley, the Land of No Sarcasm, they’re taken seriously, and tile the walls of any über-successful VC firm. Thus did the tombstone commemorating the initial $25 million funding round for Google beam forth its rays of divine benediction, like the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico City’s basilica.

A wise combatant always allows his opponent a way out, something Murthy in his maniacal pursuit of us hadn’t provided.

Here is a key insight for any startup: You may think yourself a puny midget among giants when you stride out into a marketplace, and suddenly confront such a giant via litigation or direct competition. But the reality is that larger companies often have much more to fear from you than you from them. For starters, their will to fight is less than yours. Their employees are mercenaries who don’t deeply care, and suffer from the diffuse responsibility and weak emotional investment of a larger organization. What’s an existential struggle to you is merely one more set of tasks to a tuned-out engineer bored of his own product, or another legal hassle to an already overworked legal counsel thinking more about her next stock-vesting date than your suit. Also, large companies have valuable public brands they must delicately preserve, and which can be assailed by even small companies such as yours, particularly in a tight-knit, appearances-conscious ecosystem like that of Silicon Valley. America still loves an underdog, and you’ll be surprised at how many allies come out of the woodwork when some obnoxious incumbent is challenged by a scrappy startup with a convincing story.

Finally, an email to me from PG: “Come meet me at home to discuss this on Saturday. Come alone, don’t bring the others, and try to keep them out of it.” Another brief lesson in startups: Whenever you face some stressful, time-consuming, and risky challenge, firewall the rest of the company away from the mess. They’ll likely add no value, and the attendant uncertainty will corrode their productivity when you likely need it most. No matter what happens in the outside world—lawsuit, money issues, the fucking zombie apocalypse—do not let it infect the company’s headspace and become the top item in the internal narrative.

Incidentally, it helps to have enemies.

The height represented how well a startup was doing, and the shape started with a sharp rise from zero, cresting to an apex labeled “Launch!” The peak was followed by a sudden crash and then a low plateau that ran almost the length of the plot. After much flatlining, the curve edged up slightly, before dipping again (label: “misconfigured analytics code”), and then increased at a steady pace until “acquisition.” The big, yawning space between launch peak and gradual takeoff was labeled ominously in large letters: “THE TROUGH OF SORROW.”

The acquiring company doesn’t care less how money is divided between investors and employees. As we’ve reviewed, what they care about is price per high-value person (that is, engineers and product managers).

founders face a moral choice that’s quite ticklish. They can opt to reward their investors for their investments in time and money, but they’re essentially paying them out of their wallet. The deal is very much a zero-sum game between founders and investors in the final stages.

Every new form of media initially emulates the forms of the past. The first radio shows were merely people reading books on air, or playing instruments, with no use of clever sound effects or editing. The first TV shows were quiz shows that had originally appeared on radio, with mere headshots of the contestants.

The company had a seemingly genetic inclination for home-brewing almost every element of its technical stack, using open-source languages or tools occasionally, but then customizing them to the point where they were more Facebook than anything else. Since even seasoned engineers came from a completely different universe, it was necessary to indoctrinate them in the One True Way.

Before 2013, if you wanted to know how Facebook made money, the answer was very simple: a billion times any number is still a big fucking number. Facebook monetization was laughable compared with Google’s on a purely CPM basis. But usage was ungodly. Up there with heroin, carbohydrates, or a weekly paycheck: that’s how addictive and rewarding Facebook was.

The hacker ethos prevailed above all. This culture is what kept twenty-three-year-old kids who were making half a million a year, in a city where there was lots of fun on offer if you had the cash, tethered to a corporate campus for fourteen-hour days.

Very few companies have died due to launching early; at worst, you’ll have a onetime product embarrassment (as Apple did with the first version of its iPhone Maps app). However, countless companies have died by losing the nerve to ship, and freezing into a coma of second-guessing, hesitation, and internal indecision. As in life, so in business: maintain a bias for action over inaction.

A metrics dashboard that the entire team fixates on was standard Facebook practice. Those scorecards should obsess the product manager, should be the last thing he thinks of at night and the first thing he thinks of in the morning, and should be known to him, from memory, down to the decimal. Choose well what goes in that line graph, because whatever it is, a good product manager will slave away until it’s going up and to the right, whatever that figure represents.

If we don’t create the thing that kills Facebook, someone else will. “Embracing change” isn’t enough. It has to be so hardwired into who we are that even talking about it seems redundant.

Incidentally, the fastest way you can indicate your level of startup naïveté to a VC (or to anybody in tech), is either by claiming you’re in “stealth”—that is, with an idea so secretly valuable you can’t disclose it—or by forcing someone to sign a nondisclosure agreement before you even discuss it. You may as well tattoo LOSER on your forehead instead, to save everyone the trouble. To quote one Valley sage, if your idea is any good, it won’t get stolen, you’ll have to jam it down people’s throats instead.

That’s it.

But behind it all there’s a single person: a nervous ball of needs, wants, and anxieties, whose species evolved in a Paleolithic world of toothy predators and the hunter-gatherer feast-famine duality, and who is presently confronted, a mere blip of time later, with an endless feast of blinking lights and hyperoptimized stimuli. Can you blame the poor beasts for clicking themselves to death with Candy Crush Saga, or maniacally (and frictionlessly) squandering resources they don’t have on things they don’t need?

The revenue from that sale (whether online or in the physical store) is credited toward the mobile media ad impression the advertiser paid for. Thanks to this identity bridge between all devices, advertisers know exactly what paid media influenced you to consume. The ad server, the company that actually showed you the ad on that mobile game you were playing, understands exactly which set of flashing pixels, the most virtual thing in the world, made you spend cold, hard cash. Suddenly, that mobile ad impression the games publisher sold you becomes that much more valuable.

People go into startups thinking that the technical problems are the challenges. In practice, the technical stuff is easy, unless you’re incompetent or really at the hairy edge of human knowledge—for example, putting a man on Mars. No, every real problem in startups is a people problem, and as such they’re the hardest to solve, as they often don’t have a real solution, much less a ready software fix.

One industry after another is simply knocked out via venture-backed entrepreneurial daring and hastily shipped software. Silicon Valley is the zoo where the chaos monkeys are kept, and their numbers only grow in time. With the explosion of venture capital, there is no shortage of bananas to feed them.

5) Count right now how many people can make a major decision that can ruin your life. I discuss this in the chapter “And Then They All Laughed.” I bring it up again so you can’t escape it: how many people do you have to kiss ass to in order to achieve career goals? One? Two? The point here is to not kiss ass at all. To know that there are at least twenty people who independently can help you to achieve the success you need. You build up this list of twenty people the old-fashioned way—you help them. The only way to create value for yourself is to create value for others. Exercise: think of two people in your network who don’t know each other but you think can add value to each other’s lives. Introduce them. Do this every day. Get better and better at it. The more value you bring to the people in your network (even if it doesn’t directly bring value to you in an immediate way), the greater the value of your network. And then the greater value you will have.

9) It’s okay to take baby steps. “I can’t just QUIT!” people say. “I have bills to pay.” I get it. Nobody is saying quit today. Before a human being runs a marathon they learn to crawl, then take baby steps, then walk, then run. Then exercise every day and stay healthy. Then run a marathon. Heck, what am I even talking about? I can’t run more than two miles without collapsing in agony. I am a wimp.

10) Abundance will never come from your job. Only stepping out of the prison imposed on you from your factory will allow you to achieve abundance. You can’t see it now. It’s hard to see the gardens when you are locked in jail. Abundance only comes when you are moving along your themes. When you are truly enhancing the lives of the people around you.

10) Abundance will never come from your job. Only stepping out of the prison imposed on you from your factory will allow you to achieve abundance. You can’t see it now. It’s hard to see the gardens when you are locked in jail. Abundance only comes when you are moving along your themes. When you are truly enhancing the lives of the people around you. When every day you wake up with that motive of enhancement. Enhance your family, your friends, your colleagues, your clients, potential customers, readers, people who you don’t even know yet but you would like to know. Become a beacon of enhancement, and then when the night is gray, all of the boats will move toward you, bringing their bountiful riches. This chapter is not a wake-up call. It’s not a fear-mongering, “get ready to be poor” sort of chapter. It’s not even a rallying cry to the greatness and plentitude of entrepreneurship. It’s reality.

People want to find and take the “magical path”: get VC money, quit their jobs, build a product, and then have millions of customers. It NEVER works like that.

“I didn’t want to be going up and down the street looking for customers,” Bryan said. “I needed to find a way to get online businesses as customers. Someone suggested that I needed to blog. And to blog well you need to be totally transparent or it won’t work. So I started blogging about what was really happening in the credit card industry including all the unscrupulous practices and how merchants were being taken advantage of. Then I’d put my posts on the top social sites at the time--Digg, reddit, and StumbleUpon--and sometimes the posts would get to the top of these sites and my website would get so much traffic that it would crash. “But I became a trusted source about credit card processing. So before long all these online sites that had previously had a hard time navigating this industry would start contacting me to switch their payment services.”

You don’t sell ads on your blog (rarely), you don’t get the big book deal (rarely), but you do build trust and this leads to opportunities. My own blog has made me a total of zero cents but has created millions in opportunities. In Bryan’s case it led to more inflow and his biggest early opportunity.

Rule #7: Customer Service. You can treat each customer, new and old, like a real human being. “We intuitively sort of knew what we didn’t like in customer service everywhere else: automated calling trees, slow response times, poor problem solving, etc. So we made sure there was as little friction as possible between the customer contacting us and actually getting their problem solved.” When you are a small business, there’s no excuse for having poor customer service. Your best new customers are your old customers, and the best way to touch your old customers is to provide quick help when they need it. Customer services is the most reliable touch point to keep selling your service to them.

This helped me not only build a trading business, but build a fund of hedge funds, and ultimately build stockpickr.com. I felt like I knew more about trading and the top investors out there than anyone else in the world. Creating value was almost an afterthought.

But at the current rate of incomes, and with the flight of capital out of the United States, you have to take this into account when making major life decisions.

Most jobs that existed twenty years ago aren’t needed now. Maybe they never were needed. The entire first decade of this century was spent with CEOs in their Park Avenue clubs crying through their cigars, “How are we going to fire all this dead weight?” The year 2008 finally gave them the chance. “It was the economy!” they said.

3) Corporations don’t like you. This is not a surprise to capitalists and entrepreneurs or even artists. The entire idea behind a corporation is to set up a legal structure that takes advantage of cheap labor. The cheap labor makes something for you for less than you sell it. I’m not saying this isn’t unfair. It is what it is. But you have to make sure if you are being exploited that you learn how to exploit back. You use the corporate job as a rest stop on the way toward being healthy, on the way toward figuring out how to innovate and take advantage of the mythical safety net to move onto bigger and better things.

4) Money is not happiness. A common question during my Twitter Q&A, asked at least once a week, is “Should I take the job I like or should I take the job that pays more money?” Leaving aside the question, should I take a job at all?, let’s talk about money for a second. First, the science: studies show that an increase in salary only offers marginal to zero increase in “happiness” above a certain level. Why is that? Because of this basic fact: people spend what they make. If your salary increases $5,000, you spend an extra $2,000 on features for your car, you have an affair, you buy a new computer, a better couch, a bigger TV, and then you ask, where did all the money go? Even though you needed none of the above, now you need one more thing: another increase in your salary, so back to the corporate casino for one more try at the salary roulette wheel. I have never once seen anyone save the increase in his salary. In other words, don’t stay at the job for safe salary increases over time. That will never get you where you want—freedom from financial worry. Only free time, imagination, creativity, and an ability to disappear will help you deliver value that nobody ever delivered before in the history of mankind.

The next issue is ensuring that no NULLs occur in the shellcode. This means a zero value cannot be used in any instruction argument or in any constant data (such as the terminating NULL on the end of the ”/bin/sh” string).Instead, any required zero values must be generated and saved as the code runs. The logical XOR instruction of a register value with itself generates a zero value, as is done here with the %eax register. This value can then be copied anywhere needed, such as the end of the string, and also as the value of args[1].

Bridging—even just once per week—prevents all these problems. It realigns the vertebrae into the correct position, and strengthens the deep muscles of the back responsible for proper posture. Even the bones become stronger over time, with the practice of the bridge. The discs in your back are made of cartilage, and like all cartilage, they have very little blood flow. Instead, they receive their nutrition from liquid in the joints, called synovial fluid. Because it’s not associated with the circulation, fresh fluid can only reach the joints when those joints move around. Bridging removes waste and sends plenty of nutritious fluid to the discs, healing them, preventing degeneration and ensuring maximal health. Strong spinal muscles can reduce the likelihood of slipped discs, and even help fix the condition.

At bedtime, try this practice in the supine position for a short time—five, ten, twenty minutes, or more if you like—before you go into your normal sleeping position. On the initial exhalations release first all muscular tension in the body, and once you are thoroughly relaxed physically, also release all thoughts that appear—slowly breathing out . . . out . . . out . . .—and then allow the inhalation to flow in of its own accord.

A sense of ease and relaxation is indispensable for cultivating attention skills and for dream practice. But by itself it’s not enough. We need to also introduce the element of stability—the voluntary continuity of attention. So let’s step up this practice now by narrowing the focus of attention. Instead of focusing on the whole body or letting the attention rove within the body, now zero in more steadily on the tactile sensations of the rise and fall of the abdomen with each inhalation and exhalation.

The technique for increasing vividness is to focus your attention on a subtler object, such as the sensations of the breath in the area of the nostrils. It takes greater attention to follow these sensations than the relatively coarser movement of the abdomen during respiration.

In the words of Stephen LaBerge, “dreaming can be viewed as the special case of perception without the constraints of external sensory input. Conversely, perception can be viewed as the special case of dreaming constrained by sensory input.”6 According to that statement both states of consciousness—perception when dreaming and when awake—are very similar, with overlapping networks of correlated brain mechanisms. And both states can potentially be just as clear, just as “awake.”

I recommend that mindfulness of breathing be practiced in stages one through four. For the next three stages—five through seven—I recommend settling the mind in the natural state. In this practice, attention to mental phenomena replaces focus on the breath. One observes all appearing mental events—thoughts, mental images, and emotions—neutrally, objectively, without any involvement. These events—which usually draw us in—are allowed to pass before the window of the mind like clouds blown across the sky. From stage eight onward one practices shamatha without a sign, also called awareness of awareness.

The basic technique of shamatha involves the interaction of two mental faculties: mindfulness and introspection. Mindfulness can be defined as continuous attention to a chosen object, which requires that one remember what the task is and not become distracted by other phenomena. Introspection (as the eighth-century Indian Buddhist adept Shantideva defined it) is “the repeated examination of the state of one’s body and mind.”6 Therefore introspection allows for a kind of quality control, recognizing when one’s attention strays and alerting mindfulness to reassert itself.

For Gracias, the Tesla and SpaceX investor and Musk’s friend, the 2008 period told him everything he would ever need to know about Musk’s character. He saw a man who arrived in the United States with nothing, who had lost a child, who was being pilloried in the press by reporters and his ex-wife and who verged on having his life’s work destroyed. “He has the ability to work harder and endure more stress than anyone I’ve ever met,” Gracias said. “What he went through in 2008 would have broken anyone else. He didn’t just survive. He kept working and stayed focused.” That ability to stay focused in the midst of a crisis stands as one of Musk’s main advantages over other executives and competitors. “Most people who are under that sort of pressure fray,” Gracias said. “Their decisions go bad. Elon gets hyperrational. He’s still able to make very clear, long-term decisions. The harder it gets, the better he gets. Anyone who saw what he went through firsthand came away with more respect for the guy. I’ve just never seen anything like his ability to take pain.”

Musk initially relied on textbooks to form the bulk of his rocketry knowledge. But as SpaceX hired one brilliant person after another, Musk realized he could tap into their stores of knowledge. He would trap an engineer in the SpaceX factory and set to work grilling him about a type of valve or specialized material. “I thought at first that he was challenging me to see if I knew my stuff,” said Kevin Brogan, one of the early engineers. “Then I realized he was trying to learn things. He would quiz you until he learned ninety percent of what you know.” People who have spent significant time with Musk will attest to his abilities to absorb incredible quantities of information with near-flawless recall. It’s one of his most impressive and intimidating skills and seems to work just as well in the present day as it did when he was a child vacuuming books into his brain. After a couple of years running SpaceX, Musk had turned into an aerospace expert on a level that few technology CEOs ever approach in their respective fields. “He was teaching us about the value of time, and we were teaching him about rocketry,” Brogan said.

He described what he called the five levels of awareness and said that all humans experience the first level of awareness at birth. That is when you first become aware that you exist.  In the second level of awareness you understand that other people exist. You believe most of what you are told by authority figures. You accept the belief system in which you are raised. At the third level of awareness you recognize that humans are often wrong about the things they believe. You feel that you might be wrong about some of your own beliefs but you don’t know which ones. Despite your doubts, you still find comfort in your beliefs. The fourth level is skepticism. You believe the scientific method is the best measure of what is true and you believe you have a good working grasp of truth, thanks to science, your logic, and your senses. You are arrogant when it comes to dealing with people in levels two and three. The fifth level of awareness is the Avatar. The Avatar understands that the mind is an illusion generator, not a window to reality. The Avatar recognizes science as a belief system, albeit a useful one. An Avatar is aware of God’s power as expressed in probability and the inevitable recombination of God consciousness.

Step 1. While standing with your legs slightly more than shoulder with apart, thrust your butt while raising your chest up. Your arms may hang freely by your sides. Step 2. Extend your arms up into the air, imagine yourself opening your body up to the world. As you raise your arms up, feel your chest rise and your neck start to rise up and backward behind you. Step 3. As you perform this movement more fluidly, you’ll start to feel yourself fall backwards. Your arms are reaching back behind you, almost as if you are about to fall into the ocean. You should feel your abdominal muscles and hips opening up fully. The Abundance Posture Pose should be performed frequently. I do 5-10 “reps” several times each day.

You define a subnet with two pieces: a network prefix and a subnet mask (such as the one in the output of ifconfig in the previous section). Let’s say you want to create a subnet containing the IP addresses between 10.23.2.1 and 10.23.2.254. The network prefix is the part that is common to all addresses in the subnet; in this example, it’s 10.23.2.0, and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.

This host is connected to a local network of 10.23.2.0/24 and can directly reach hosts on that network. To reach hosts on the rest of the Internet, it must communicate through the router at 10.23.2.1. How does the Linux kernel distinguish between these two different kinds of destinations? It uses a destination configuration called a routing table to determine its routing behavior. To show the routing table, use the route -n command.

The output from traceroute can be inconsistent. For example, the replies may time out at a certain step, only to “reappear” in later steps.

The Linux kernel maintains its own division between the two layers and provides communication standards for linking them called a (kernel) network interface. When you configure a network interface, you link the IP address settings from the Internet side with the hardware identification on the physical device side. Network interfaces have names that usually indicate the kind of hardware underneath, such as eth0 (the first Ethernet card in the computer) and wlan0 (a wireless interface).

Upon startup, NetworkManager gathers all available network device information, searches its list of connections, and then decides to try to activate one. Here’s how it makes that decision for Ethernet interfaces: If a wired connection is available, try to connect using it. Otherwise, try the wireless connections. Scan the list of available wireless networks. If a network is available that you’ve previously connected to, NetworkManager will try it again. If more than one previously connected wireless networks are available, select the most recently connected.

For a very quick summary of your current connection status, use the nm-tool command with no arguments. You’ll get a list of interfaces and configuration parameters. In some ways, this is like ifconfig except that there’s more detail, especially when viewing wireless connections. To control NetworkManager from the command line, use the nmcli command. This is a somewhat extensive command. See the nmcli(1) manual page for more information. Finally, the utility nm-online will tell you whether the network is up or down. If the network is up, the command returns zero as its exit code; it’s nonzero otherwise.

On Unix systems, a process uses a socket to identify when and how it’s talking to the network. Sockets are the interface that processes use to access the network through the kernel; they represent the boundary between user space and kernel space. They’re often also used for interprocess communication (IPC).

Developers like Unix domain sockets for IPC for two reasons. First, they allow developers the option to use special socket files in the filesystem to control access, so any process that doesn’t have access to a socket file can’t use it. And because there’s no interaction with the network, it’s simpler and less prone to conventional network intrusion.

The kernel runs in kernel mode, and the user processes run in user mode. Code running in kernel mode has unrestricted access to the processor and main memory. This is a powerful but dangerous privilege that allows a kernel process to easily crash the entire system. The area that only the kernel can access is called kernel space. User mode, in comparison, restricts access to a (usually quite small) subset of memory and safe CPU operations. User space refers to the parts of main memory that the user processes can access.

Character devices don’t have a size; when you read from or write to one, the kernel usually performs a read or write operation on the device. Printers directly attached to your computer are represented by character devices. It’s important to note that during character device interaction, the kernel cannot back up and reexamine the data stream after it has passed data to a device or process.

It is important for tasks to be treated with a certain degree of fairness, including the stipulation that no thread ever starves. Starvation happens when a thread is not allowed to run for an unacceptably long period of time due to the prioritization of other threads over it. Starvation must not be allowed to happen, though certain threads should be allowed to have a considerably higher priority level than others based on user-deﬁned values and/or heuristic indicators. Somehow, threads that are approaching the starvation threshold (which is

When a task runs out of timeslice, it is removed from the active priority array and put into the expired priority array. During this move, a new timeslice is calculated. When there are no more runnable tasks in the active priority array, the pointers to the active and expired priority arrays are simply swapped

If another task has not run for longer than STARVATION_LIMIT speciﬁes, then interactive tasks stop running in order for the starving tasks to get CPU time.

The Linux 2.4.x scheduling algorithm divides time into “epochs,” which are periods of time during which every task is allowed to use up its timeslice. Timeslices are computed for all tasks when epochs begin, which means that the scheduler’s algorithm for timeslice calculation runs in O(n) time since it must iterate over every task.

large timeslices can cause the time between executions of low-priority tasks (or simply unlucky ones if all priorities are equal) to grow quite large. For example - with 100 threads using all of their 210ms timeslices without pause, the lowest priority thread in the group might have to wait more than 20 seconds before it executes (an unlikely situation, but it illustrates the point). This problem does not appear to be mitigated by starvation checks or taking system load into account when calculating timeslices, which might not help anyway

Here’s a summary of good conversation technique. Ask questions. Don’t complain (much). Don’t talk about boring experiences (TV show, meal, dream, etc.). Don’t dominate the conversation. Let others talk. Don’t get stuck on a topic. Keep moving. Planning is useful but it isn’t conversation. Keep the sad stories short, especially medical stories. The point of conversation is to make the other person feel good. If you do that one simple thing correctly, the other benefits come along with the deal.

As a writer, I reflexively translate whatever I observe into a story form with a setup, a twist if there is one, and some sort of punch line or thought that ties it in a bow. You can do the same thing. Try to get in the habit of asking yourself how you can turn your interesting experiences into story form. I find it helps to imagine telling the story to someone in particular—a spouse, friend, or relative. Try a few versions in your head, telling the story and feeling how it goes. Was it brief? Did you save the surprise for just the right moment? Did you have a way to end the story with a punch line or interesting observation? It’s a good idea to always have a backlog of stories you can pull out at a moment’s notice.

Topics to Avoid It’s important to tell stories about interesting events. It’s even more important to avoid telling stories about deadly boring or downer situations. Here are a few topics you should avoid. Food: People don’t care how good your meal was unless they plan to eat at the same place soon. I will agree that some extreme foodies can actually get pleasure from hearing about food. But even in that case you want to keep it short. Television show plots: Talking about TV shows that you and your conversation partner both enjoy can be fun and entertaining. But no one wants to hear the entire plot of a television show that you watched and they didn’t. Dreams: No one cares about the details of your dream. If you must discuss your dreams, keep it to one sentence, as in “I dreamed that a chipmunk with a face that looked like Winston Churchill was swimming in my cereal bowl.” Medical stories: If you are normal, or anywhere near it, you will talk too much about your health issues no matter how persuasively I tell you that it’s a bad idea. And people will ask about your health if they know there’s something wrong with you. So you can’t entirely avoid talking about your medical problems. Just keep your stories light, funny if possible, and short. Most important, recognize that it’s your responsibility to change the subject as soon as you can. Other people will feel awkward changing the subject from your health problems because there’s no way to do it gracefully. That’s your job.

I say quality is overrated when it comes to humor, but you do need to achieve a minimum threshold. And that usually means avoiding a handful of traps. If you avoid the traps, you’re golden. Allow me to map the traps for you. I’ll start with a summary then explain. Overcomplaining is never funny. Don’t overdo the self-deprecation. Don’t mock people. Avoid puns and wordplay.

A normal slot machine that requires money will bankrupt any player in the long run. But the machine that has rare yet certain payoffs, and asks for no money up front, is a guaranteed winner if you have what it takes to keep yanking until you get lucky. In that environment, you can fail 99 percent of the time, while knowing success is guaranteed. All you need to do is stay in the game long enough.

I had just deposited the biggest check of my life, thanks largely to a multibook publishing deal. I had the precise job I had wanted since childhood. I was officially rich. I was as famous as I wanted to be. And I was suddenly and profoundly sad. What the hell was going on? After some self-reflection I realized that I was feeling adrift. I no longer had a primary purpose in life because I’d already achieved it. It was an eerie feeling, unreal and unsettling. I had no kids at the time, so I had no reason to achieve anything more. I’d dipped well below my baseline happiness and I wasn’t rebounding. The way I climbed out of my funk was by realizing that my newly acquired resources could help me change the world in some small but positive ways. That was the motivation for creating the Dilberito, which I hoped would make nutrition convenient and perhaps contribute to a trend. In the long run, the Dilberito didn’t work out. But it was 100 percent successful in giving me a meaningful purpose, which allowed my optimism and energy to return. Unhappiness that is caused by too much success is a high-class problem. That’s the sort of unhappiness people work all of their lives to get. If you find yourself there, and I hope you do, you’ll find your attention naturally turning outward. You’ll seek happiness through service to others. I promise it will feel wonderful.

I figured I had two ways to leave my job. I could get fired or—and here’s the optimist emerging—I could get promoted. I wrote a letter to the senior vice president for the branch system, who was probably seven or eight layers of management above me, and described all of my naive suggestions for improving the bank. My ideas had one thing in common: They were impractical for reasons a twenty-one-year-old wouldn’t yet appreciate. I closed my letter by asking for a rare and coveted spot in the management training program, a fast track to upper management. It was a long shot for a guy who had on his permanent work record some version of “too incompetent to write numbers on a piece of paper.” I included in my letter a list of my qualifications that contained a witty reference to getting robbed twice at gunpoint in the course of my work, which was true. As luck would have it, the senior vice president was a six-foot-ten, red-headed, bearded elf of a man who had a great sense of humor. He read my letter and invited me to his office for an interview.

it’s a good idea to dedicate certain sitting positions and certain work spaces to work and other spaces to relaxation or play. That makes your physical environment a sort of user interface for your brain, and it becomes a way to manipulate your energy levels and concentration. To change how you feel, and how you think, you can simply change where you are sitting.

But have faith. You are not as powerless as you appear. Your moment is about to come. Yes, this book is going to offer you a choice. Decision time arrives a few hours later. The sun has set and your mother has shifted you onto the cot, where you lie swaddled in a blanket even though the evening is warm. The men have returned from the fields, and the family, all except you, have eaten together in the courtyard. Through your doorway you can hear the gurgle of a water pipe and see the flare of its coals as one of your uncles inhales. Your parents stand over you, looking down. Tomorrow your father will return to the city. He is thinking. “Will you be all right?” he asks you. It is the first question he has asked you on this visit, perhaps the first sentence he has uttered to you directly in months. You are in pain and frightened. So the answer is obviously no. Yet you say, “Yes.” And take your destiny into your own hands.

As you lie motionless afterwards, a young jaundiced village boy, radish juice dribbling from the corner of your lips and forming a small patch of mud on the ground, it must seem that getting filthy rich is beyond your reach. But have faith. You are not as powerless as you appear. Your moment is about to come. Yes, this book is going to offer you a choice. Decision time arrives a few hours later. The sun has set and your mother has shifted you onto the cot, where you lie swaddled in a blanket even though the evening is warm. The men have returned from the fields, and the family, all except you, have eaten together in the courtyard. Through your doorway you can hear the gurgle of a water pipe and see the flare of its coals as one of your uncles inhales. Your parents stand over you, looking down. Tomorrow your father will return to the city. He is thinking. “Will you be all right?” he asks you. It is the first question he has asked you on this visit, perhaps the first sentence he has uttered to you directly in months. You are in pain and frightened. So the answer is obviously no. Yet you say, “Yes.” And take your destiny into your own hands.

Entrepreneurship in the barbaric wastes furthest from state power is a fraught endeavor, a constant battle, a case of kill or be killed, with little guarantee of success. No, harnessing the state’s might for personal gain is a much more sensible approach. Two related categories of actor have long understood this. Bureaucrats, who wear state uniforms while secretly backing their private interests. And bankers, who wear private uniforms while secretly being backed by the state. You will need the help of both. But in rising Asia, where bureaucrats lead, bankers tend to follow, and so it is on befriending the right bureaucrat that your continued success critically depends.

With borrowed funds, a business can invest, gain leverage, and leverage is a pair of wings. Leverage is flight. Leverage is a way for small to be big and big to be huge, a glorious abstraction, the promise of tomorrow today, yes, a liberation from time, the resounding triumph of human will over dreary, chronology-shackled physical reality. To leverage is to be immortal. Or if not, your deputy asserts, at least the converse is true. “If we don’t borrow,” he says, “we’ll die.”

as far as getting rich is concerned, love can be an impediment. Yes, the pursuit of love and the pursuit of wealth have much in common. Both have the potential to inspire, motivate, uplift, and kill. But whereas achieving a massive bank balance demonstrably attracts fine physical specimens desperate to give their love in exchange, achieving love tends to do the opposite. It dampens the fire in the steam furnace of ambition, robbing of essential propulsion an already fraught upriver journey to the heart of financial success.

All the conditions that decrease an emergency victim’s chances for bystander aid exist normally and innocently in the city: (1) In contrast to rural areas, cities are more clamorous, distracting, rapidly changing places where it is difficult to be certain of the nature of the events one encounters. (2) Urban environments are more populous, by their nature; consequently, people are more likely to be with others when witnessing a potential emergency situation. (3) City dwellers know a much smaller percentage of fellow residents than do people who live in small towns; therefore, city dwellers are more likely to find themselves in a group of strangers when observing an emergency.

The story of the Werther effect is both chilling and intriguing. More than two centuries ago, the great man of German literature, Johann von Goethe, published a novel entitled Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (The Sorrows of Young Werther). The book, in which the hero, named Werther, commits suicide, had a remarkable impact. Not only did it provide Goethe with immediate fame, but it also sparked a wave of emulative suicides across Europe. So powerful was this effect that authorities in several countries banned the novel.

An automatic-pilot device, like social proof, should never be trusted fully; even when no saboteur has fed bad information into the mechanism, it can sometimes go haywire by itself. We need to check the machine from time to time to be sure that it hasn’t worked itself out of sync with the other sources of evidence in the situation—the objective facts, our prior experiences, our own judgments. Fortunately, this precaution requires neither much effort nor much time. A quick glance around is all that is needed.

Although the obligation to repay constitutes the essence of the reciprocity rule, it is the obligation to receive that makes the rule so easy to exploit. The obligation to receive reduces our ability to choose whom we wish to be indebted to and puts that power in the hands of others.

Another consequence of the rule, however, is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us. As my research group thought about it, we realized that was exactly the position the Boy Scout had put me in. His request that I purchase some one-dollar chocolate bars had been put in the form of a concession on his part; it was presented as a retreat from his request that I buy some five-dollar tickets. If I were to live up to the dictates of the reciprocation rule, there had to be a concession on my part. As we have seen, there was such a concession: I changed from noncompliant to compliant when he changed from a larger to a smaller request, even though I was not really interested in either of the things he offered.

After all, if there were no social obligation to reciprocate a concession, who would want to make the first sacrifice? To do so would be to risk giving up something and getting nothing back. However, with the rule in effect, we can feel safe making the first sacrifice to our partner, who is obligated to offer a return sacrifice.

Research conducted at Bar-Ilan University in Israel on the rejection-then-retreat technique shows that if the first set of demands is so extreme as to be seen as unreasonable, the tactic backfires.17 In such cases, the party who has made the extreme first request is not seen to be bargaining in good faith. Any subsequent retreat from that wholly unrealistic initial position is not viewed as a genuine concession and thus is not reciprocated.

One of the beauties of this tactic is that by first requesting ten dollars and then retreating to five dollars, I will have simultaneously engaged the force of the reciprocity rule and the contrast principle. Not only will my five-dollar request be viewed as a concession to be reciprocated, it will also look to you like a smaller request than if I had just asked for it straightaway.

The toy manufacturers, of course, make a point of supplying the stores with plenty of these substitutes. Then, after Christmas, the companies start running the ads again for the other, special toys.

What the Freedman and Fraser findings tell us, then, is to be very careful about agreeing to trivial requests. Such an agreement can not only increase our compliance with very similar, much larger requests, it can also make us more willing to perform a variety of larger favors that are only remotely connected to the little one we did earlier. It’s this second, general kind of influence concealed within small commitments that scares me.

The results were quite clear. The students who had never written down their first choices were the least loyal to those choices. When new evidence was presented that questioned the wisdom of decisions that had never left their heads, these students were the most influenced by the new information to change what they had viewed as the “correct” decision. Compared to these uncommitted students, those who had merely written their decisions for a moment on a Magic Pad were significantly less willing to change their minds when given the chance. Even though they had committed themselves under the most anonymous of circumstances, the act of writing down their first judgments caused them to resist the influence of contradictory new data and to remain consistent with the preliminary choices. But Deutsch and Gerard found that, by far, it was the students who had publicly recorded their initial positions who most resolutely refused to shift from those positions later. Public commitment had hardened them into the most stubborn of all.

Although the settings are quite different, the surveyed fraternities refused to allow civic activities into their initiation ceremonies for the same reason that the Chinese withheld large prizes in favor of less powerful inducements: They wanted the men to own what they had done. No excuses, no ways out were allowed. A man who suffered through an arduous hazing could not be given the chance to believe he did so for charitable purposes. A prisoner who salted his political essay with a few anti-American comments could not be permitted to shrug it off as motivated by a big reward.

Therefore, if we train ourselves to be attentive, we should register it ever so slightly before our cognitive apparatus engages. According to this approach, were Sara to ask herself the crucial “Would I make the same choice again?” question, she would be well advised to look for and trust the first flash of feeling she experienced in response.

If they could spread the Word, if they could inform the uninformed, if they could persuade the skeptics, and if, by so doing, they could win new converts, their threatened but treasured beliefs would become truer. The principle of social proof says so: The greater the number of people who find any idea correct, the more the idea will be correct. The group’s assignment was clear; since the physical evidence could not be changed, the social evidence had to be. Convince and ye shall be convinced!

In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct. In the process of examining the reactions of other people to resolve our uncertainty, however, we are likely to overlook a subtle but important fact. Those people are probably examining the social evidence, too.

There is a principle in human perception, the contrast principle, that affects the way we see the difference between two things that are presented one after another. Simply put, if the second item is fairly different from the first, we will tend to see it as more different than it actually is. So if we lift a light object first and then lift a heavy object, we will estimate the second object to be heavier than if we had lifted it without first trying the light one.

So Brian, out of the competition due to his shoulder, recently knocked unconscious, but still a gentleman and sportsman, offered his opponent his own West Side T-shirt, the one he had worn to the competition. I watched Brian take off his shirt and hand it to the dude who just knocked him unconscious and separated his shoulder (illegally I might add).  That act of kindness was one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen at a tournament. Brian understands competition. He sees people instead of victory or medals or podiums. He understands the nature of competition and he doesn’t let the desire to win overpower his humanity. Brian left that tournament without a medal or his shirt, but he still left victorious.

Brad has limited use of his legs, and he adds, his butt cheeks (which he points out are very important in one’s movement). He’s a funny man. I noticed rather quickly that he never gave himself an out when it came to a technique. If he couldn’t do it, he would work on it with a partner until he could make the technique fit his body–make it fit his situation (or he would figure out some way to turn it into a neck crank). This to me is the spirit of Helio–the modification and alteration of jiu-jitsu so that it is effective for one’s own situation, one’s own circumstance.

A what if is only a speculation and it’s usually a bad one, a negative thought, but we have to realize that there are positive What Ifs that balance the equation. So the best thing to do is to not even ask the question. You see a good opportunity to shoot a single—shoot a single! Focus on the shot not the outcome. Don’t think about it, do it.

You create space by moving the hips as far away from your opponent’s hips as possible.

There was a man who had a skin condition that made his skin itch all the time. Every time he scratched his itch, he felt good. Then one day, a skillful doctor cured him of his skin condition, and he didn’t have to scratch anymore. He realized that scratching his itch had felt good, but not having to scratch an itch at all feels even better. We have a mind condition that makes us itch for two types of pleasure: pleasure of the senses and pleasure of the ego. When our senses are pleasantly stimulated, as when we eat something tasty, or our ego is pleasantly stimulated, as when we are praised for something we did, we feel joy, which is good. What is even better is if we can feel joy independent of sense or ego pleasure.

Forming an LLC is a great way to protect your assets. However, it’s important to point out that you don’t have to limit yourself to one LLC. As the old saying goes, don’t put all of the eggs in just one basket. Let’s assume that you only have one LLC and you placed all of your rental properties under it. If an accident happens to one of your tenants while he/she is in your property, the rest of the properties will also be in jeopardy (since they belong to the same LLC). You can prevent this problem by dividing your properties among different LLCs.

The private key (k) is a number, usually picked at random. From the private key, we use elliptic curve multiplication, a one-way cryptographic function, to generate a public key (K). From the public key (K), we use a one-way cryptographic hash function to generate a bitcoin address (A).

The public key is calculated from the private key using elliptic curve multiplication, which is irreversible: where k is the private key, G is a constant point called the generator point and K is the resulting public key. The reverse operation, known as “finding the discrete logarithm” — calculating k if you know K — is as difficult as trying all possible values of k, i.e., a brute-force search.

This shortcut can be used to create very secure public-key-only deployments where a server or application has a copy of an extended public key and no private keys whatsoever. That kind of deployment can produce an infinite number of public keys and bitcoin addresses, but cannot spend any of the money sent to those addresses. Meanwhile, on another, more secure server, the extended private key can derive all the corresponding private keys to sign transactions and spend the money.

A single leaked child private key, together with a parent chain code, reveals all the private keys of all the children. Worse, the child private key together with a parent chain code can be used to deduce the parent private key. To counter this risk, HD wallets use an alternative derivation function called hardened derivation, which “breaks” the relationship between parent public key and child chain code. The hardened derivation function uses the parent private key to derive the child chain code, instead of the parent public key.

When a chain of transactions is transmitted across the network, they don’t always arrive in the same order. Sometimes, the child might arrive before the parent. In that case, the nodes that see a child first can see that it references a parent transaction that is not yet known. Rather than reject the child, they put it in a temporary pool to await the arrival of its parent and propagate it to every other node. The pool of transactions without parents is known as the orphan transaction pool. Once the parent arrives, any orphans that reference the UTXO created by the parent are released from the pool, revalidated recursively, and then the entire chain of transactions can be included in the transaction pool, ready to be mined in a block.

Bitcoin transaction validation is not based on a static pattern, but instead is achieved through the execution of a scripting language. This language allows for a nearly infinite variety of conditions to be expressed. This is how bitcoin gets the power of “programmable money.”

First, the unlocking script is executed, using the stack execution engine. If the unlocking script executed without errors (e.g., it has no “dangling” operators left over), the main stack (not the alternate stack) is copied and the locking script is executed. If the result of executing the locking script with the stack data copied from the unlocking script is “TRUE,” the unlocking script has succeeded in resolving the conditions imposed by the locking script and, therefore, the input is a valid authorization to spend the UTXO.

It requires minimal processing and cannot do many of the fancy things modern programming languages can do. In the case of programmable money, that is a deliberate security feature. Bitcoin’s scripting language is called a stack-based language because it uses a data structure called a stack. A stack is a very simple data structure, which can be visualized as a stack of cards. A stack allows two operations: push and pop. Push adds an item on top of the stack. Pop removes the top item from the stack. The scripting language executes the script by processing each item from left to right. Numbers (data constants) are pushed onto the stack. Operators push or pop one or more parameters from the stack, act on them, and might push a result onto the stack. For example, OP_ADD will pop two items from the stack, add them, and push the resulting sum onto the stack. Conditional operators evaluate a condition, producing a boolean

A P2SH transaction locks the output to this hash instead of the longer script, using the locking script: OP_HASH160 54c557e07dde5bb6cb791c7a540e0a4796f5e97e OP_EQUAL which, as you can see, is much shorter. Instead of “pay to this 5-key multi-signature script,” the P2SH equivalent transaction is “pay to a script with this hash.”

SPV nodes download only the block headers and do not download the transactions included in each block. The resulting chain of blocks, without transactions, is 1,000 times smaller than the full blockchain. SPV nodes cannot construct a full picture of all the UTXOs that are available for spending because they do not know about all the transactions on the network. SPV nodes verify transactions using a slightly different methodology that relies on peers to provide partial views of relevant parts of the blockchain on demand.

An SPV node cannot validate whether the UTXO is unspent. Instead, the SPV node will establish a link between the transaction and the block that contains it, using a merkle path (see Merkle Trees). Then, the SPV node waits until it sees the six blocks 300,001 through 300,006 piled on top of the block containing the transaction and verifies it by establishing its depth under blocks 300,006 to 300,001. The fact that other nodes on the network accepted block 300,000 and then did the necessary work to produce six more blocks on top of it is proof, by proxy, that the transaction was not a double-spend.

To defend against this, an SPV node needs to connect randomly to several nodes, to increase the probability that it is in contact with at least one honest node. This need to randomly connect means that SPV nodes also are vulnerable to network partitioning attacks or Sybil attacks, where they are connected to fake nodes or fake networks and do not have access to honest nodes or the real bitcoin network. For most practical purposes, well-connected SPV nodes are secure enough, striking the right balance between resource needs, practicality, and security. For infallible security, however, nothing beats running a full blockchain node.

To test if a pattern is part of a bloom filter, the pattern is hashed by each hash function and the resulting bit pattern is tested against the bit array. If all the bits indexed by the hash functions are set to 1, then the pattern is probably recorded in the bloom filter. Because the bits may be set because of overlap from multiple patterns, the answer is not certain, but is rather probabilistic. In simple terms, a bloom filter positive match is a “Maybe, Yes.”

Merkle tree is constructed by recursively hashing pairs of nodes until there is only one hash, called the root, or merkle root. The cryptographic hash algorithm used in bitcoin’s merkle trees is SHA256 applied twice, also known as double-SHA256. When N data elements are hashed and summarized in a merkle tree, you can check to see if any one data element is included in the tree with at most 2*log2(N) calculations, making this a very efficient data structure.

With merkle trees, a node can download just the block headers (80 bytes per block) and still be able to identify a transaction’s inclusion in a block by retrieving a small merkle path from a full node, without storing or transmitting the vast majority of the blockchain, which might be several gigabytes in size.

The SPV node will establish a bloom filter on its connections to peers to limit the transactions received to only those containing addresses of interest. When a peer sees a transaction that matches the bloom filter, it will send that block using a merkleblock message. The merkleblock message contains the block header as well as a merkle path that links the transaction of interest to the merkle root in the block. The SPV node can use this merkle path to connect the transaction to the block and verify that the transaction is included in the block. The SPV node also uses the block header to link the block to the rest of the blockchain.

In practice, it has become evident that the hoarding instinct caused by a deflationary currency can be overcome by discounting from vendors, until the discount overcomes the hoarding instinct of the buyer. Because the seller is also motivated to hoard, the discount becomes the equilibrium price at which the two hoarding instincts are matched.

The solution was to use the coinbase transaction as a source of extra nonce values. Because the coinbase script can store between 2 and 100 bytes of data, miners started using that space as extra nonce space, allowing them to explore a much larger range of block header values to find valid blocks.

Even the fastest consumer ASIC mining system cannot keep up with commercial systems that stack tens of thousands of these chips in giant warehouses near hydro-electric power stations. Miners now collaborate to form mining pools, pooling their hashing power and sharing the reward among thousands of participants. By participating in a pool, miners get a smaller share of the overall reward, but typically get rewarded every day, reducing uncertainty.

Transactions move value from transaction inputs to transaction outputs. An input is where the coin value is coming from, usually a previous transaction’s output. A transaction output assigns a new owner to the value by associating it with a key. The destination key is called an encumbrance. It imposes a requirement for a signature for the funds to be redeemed in future transactions.

By setting a lower difficulty for earning shares, the pool measures the amount of work done by each miner. Each time a pool miner finds a block header hash that is less than the pool difficulty, she proves she has done the hashing work to find that result. More importantly, the work to find shares contributes, in a statistically measurable way, to the overall effort to find a hash lower than the bitcoin network’s target.

P2Pool is a peer-to-peer mining pool, without a central operator. P2Pool works by decentralizing the functions of the pool server, implementing a parallel blockchain-like system called a share chain. A share chain is a blockchain running at a lower difficulty than the bitcoin blockchain. The share chain allows pool miners to collaborate in a decentralized pool, by mining shares on the share chain at a rate of one share block every 30 seconds. Each of the blocks on the share chain records a proportionate share reward for the pool miners who contribute work, carrying the shares forward from the previous share block. When one of the share blocks also achieves the difficulty target of the bitcoin network, it is propagated and included on the bitcoin blockchain, rewarding all the pool miners who contributed to all the shares that preceded the winning share block.

One attack scenario against the consensus mechanism is called the “51% attack.” In this scenario a group of miners, controlling a majority (51%) of the total network’s hashing power, collude to attack bitcoin. With the ability to mine the majority of the blocks, the attacking miners can cause deliberate “forks” in the blockchain and double-spend transactions or execute denial-of-service attacks against specific transactions or addresses. A fork/double-spend attack is one where the attacker causes previously confirmed blocks to be invalidated by forking below them and re-converging on an alternate chain.

To color the coins, the user defines the associated metadata, such as the type of issuance, whether it can be subdivided into smaller units, a symbol and description, and other related information. Once colored, these coins can be bought and sold, subdivided, and aggregated, and receive dividend payments. The colored coins can also be “uncolored” by removing the special association and redeemed for their face value in bitcoin.

I personally keep the vast majority of my bitcoins (99% or more) stored on paper wallets, encrypted with BIP0038, with multiple copies locked in safes. Keeping bitcoin offline is called cold storage and it is one of the most effective security techniques. A cold storage system is one where the keys are generated on an offline system (one never connected to the Internet) and stored offline either on paper or on digital media, such as a USB memory stick.

In July of 2011, a well-known bitcoin awareness and education project lost almost 7,000 bitcoins. In their effort to prevent theft, the owners had implemented a complex series of encrypted backups. In the end they accidentally lost the encryption keys, making the backups worthless and losing a fortune. Like hiding money by burying it in the desert, if you secure your bitcoin too well you might not be able to find it again.

As more miners started joining the bitcoin network, the difficulty of the problem increased rapidly. Soon, Jing and other miners upgraded to more specialized hardware, such as high-end dedicated graphical processing units (GPUs) cards such as those used in gaming desktops or consoles. At the time of this writing, the difficulty is so high that it is profitable only to mine with application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), essentially hundreds of mining algorithms printed in hardware, running in parallel on a single silicon chip.

Then there’s the tone that establishment media outlets use to discuss government wrongdoing. The culture of US journalism mandates that reporters avoid any clear or declarative statements and incorporate government assertions into their reporting, treating them with respect no matter how frivolous they are. They use what the Post’s own media columnist, Erik Wemple, derides as middle-of-the-road-ese: never saying anything definitive but instead vesting with equal credence the government’s defenses and the actual facts, all of which has the effect of diluting revelations to a muddled, incoherent, often inconsequential mess. Above all else, they invariably give great weight to official claims, even when those claims are patently false or deceitful. It was that fear-driven, obsequious journalism that led the Times, the Post, and many other outlets to refuse to use the word “torture” in their reporting on Bush interrogation techniques, even though they freely used that word to describe the exact same tactics when used by other governments around the world.

1. In regards to obesity, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, other metabolic derangement, digestive disorders, and autoimmune diseases to get the quickest/best results, it is recommended to go on a lower carbohydrate (typically <125g of carbohydrates from any source) or ketogenic diet (typically <30g carbohydrates) per day and get the rest of calories from protein, animal fats, or coconut/avocados/nuts. 2. In regards to athletes, the carbohydrate level can be increased through greater consumption of dietary carbohydrates in fruits and vegetables or good starches found in real foods such as sweet potatoes. 3. In regards to healthy living in otherwise disease free individuals, low or no carbohydrate diets are not recommended. Generally speaking, low carbohydrate and ketogenic diets are useful for correcting metabolic derangement and helping to reverse disease processes that are brought on by the “big four” factors that foster the diseases of civilization: (1) refined carbohydrates, in particular, fructose; (2) grains; (3) trans fats; and (4) omega 3:6 imbalances.

The body uses inflammation to signal and start to repair the damage caused by working out. An inflammation cascade is initiated and maintained by the immune system until all tissues are repaired and strengthened against the stress that was placed on the body. In addition, stress from activity especially sustained activity elevates cortisol levels. Cortisol helps mobilize the body's supply of fat and glucose to provide fuel for the muscle, but it is an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive. For example, cortisone is a derivative of the same class of drugs, the glucocorticoids, and is used therapeutically to reduce pain and inflammation in specific areas of the body. Our immune system is the way that our body fights infections and other pathogens that make us sick. So you can see how diverting the immune system away from fighting infections towards repairing muscles may be problematic

Myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy are the two types of hypertrophy that occur primarily in HTMUs and LTMUs respectively. As we talked about above, hypertrophy in HTMUs result primarily from protein breakdown of the actin and myosin proteins that facilitate muscular contractions. Thus, the body starts adding more contractile proteins – myofibrils – in response to the break down to mitigate it next time. This is the essence of myofibrillar hypertrophy. Conversely, since LTMUs have many mitochondria they fatigue much slower than the fast twitch counterparts. Thus, most of the stress on the cell is metabolic accumulation of muscular acidosis, reactive oxygen species, and free radicals. In response to this stress, the LTMUs add additional proteins and metabolites that draw more water into the cell creating sarcoplasmic hypertrophy

Otherwise, it terminates the program with a segmentation fault error. • If there is not enough room to load the memory from disk, Linux will move another part of the program or another program onto disk to make room. • Linux then moves the data into a free physical memory address. • Linux updates the processor’s virtual-to-physical memory mapping tables to reﬂect the changes. • Linux restores control to the program, causing it to re-issue the instruction which caused this process to happen. • The processor can now handle the instruction using the newly-loaded memory and translation tables

If you need more memory, you can just tell Linux where you want the new break point to be, and Linux will map all the memory you need between the current and new break point, and then move the break point to the spot you specify. That memory is now available for your program to use. The way we tell Linux to move the break point is through the brk system call

Whenever you need a certain amount of memory, you can simply tell allocate how much you need, and it will give you back an address to the memory. When you’re done with it, you tell deallocate that you are through with it. allocate will then be able to reuse the memory. This pattern of memory management is called dynamic memory allocation. This minimizes the number of "holes" in your memory, making sure that you are making the best use of it you can. The pool of memory used by memory managers is commonly referred to as the heap

The way memory managers work is that they keep track of where the system break is, and where the memory that you have allocated is. They mark each block of memory in the heap as being used or unused. When you request memory, the memory manager checks to see if there are any unused blocks of the appropriate size. If not, it calls the brk system call to request more memory

When you increase the size of a signed quantity in two’s complement representation, you have to perform sign extension. Sign extension means that you have to pad the left-hand side of the quantity with whatever digit is in the sign digit when you add bits. So, if we extend a negative number by 4 digits, we should ﬁll the new digits with a 1. If we extend a positive number by 4 digits, we should ﬁll the new digits with a 0

In summary, the end result in making a decision to own a house that is too expensive in lieu of starting an investment portfolio impacts an individual in at least the following three ways: 1.Loss of time, during which other assets could have grown in value. 2.Loss of additional capital, which could have been invested instead of paying for high-maintenance expenses related directly to the home. 3.Loss of education. Too often, people count their house and savings and retirement plans as all they have in their asset column. Because they have no money to invest, they simply don’t invest. This costs them investment experience. Most never become what the investment world calls “a sophisticated investor.” And the best investments are usually first sold to sophisticated investors, who then turn around and sell them to the people playing it safe.

So did Bill Gates. A $75,000 house offered for $60,000 that cost $20,000 was also the result of seizing an opportunity created by the market. Somebody was buying, and someone was selling. 4.The law The law is the awareness of accounting corporate, state and federal regulations. I recommend playing by the rules.

There have been many times I have bought a house, a stock, or an apartment building without a penny in the bank. I once bought an apartment house for $1.2 million. I did what is called “tying it up,” with a written contract between seller and buyer. I then raised the $100,000 deposit, which bought me 90 days to raise the rest of the money. Why did I do it? Simply because I knew it was worth $2 million. I never raised the money. Instead, the person who put up the $100,000 gave me $50,000 for finding the deal, took over my position, and I walked away. Total working time: three days. Again, it’s what you know more than what you buy. Investing is not buying. It’s more a case of knowing.

Twenty-five years later, nine of these titans ended their lives as follows: Schwab died penniless after living for five years on borrowed money. Insull died broke in a foreign land, and Kreuger and Cotton also died broke. Hopson went insane. Whitney and Albert Fall were released from prison, and Fraser and Livermore committed suicide.

As a child, my dad often told us that the Japanese were aware of three powers: the power of the sword, the jewel, and the mirror. The sword symbolizes the power of weapons. America has spent trillions of dollars on weapons and, because of this, is a powerful military presence in the world. The jewel symbolizes the power of money. There is some degree of truth to the saying, “Remember the golden rule. He who has the gold makes the rules.” The mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge. This self-knowledge, according to Japanese legend, was the most treasured of the three.

“REST”, which is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is an architectural style for developing distributed, networked systems and software applications such as the World Wide Web and web applications. Although REST theory is rather abstract, in the context of Rails applications REST means that most application components (such as users and microposts) are modeled as resources that can be created, read, updated, and deleted—operations that correspond both to the CRUD operations of relational databases and to the four fundamental HTTP request methods: POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE.

When a test is especially short or simple compared to the application code it tests, lean toward writing the test first. When the desired behavior isn’t yet crystal clear, lean toward writing the application code first, then write a test to codify the result. Because security is a top priority, err on the side of writing tests of the security model first. Whenever a bug is found, write a test to reproduce it and protect against regressions, then write the application code to fix it. Lean against writing tests for code (such as detailed HTML structure) likely to change in the future. Write tests before refactoring code, focusing on testing error-prone code that’s especially likely to break.

we’ll usually write controller and model tests first and integration tests (which test functionality across models, views, and controllers) second.

This code calls the each method on the range (1..5) and passes it the block { |i| puts 2 * i }. The vertical bars around the variable name in |i| are Ruby syntax for a block variable, and it’s up to the method to know what to do with the block. In this case, the range’s each method can handle a block with a single local variable, which we’ve called i, and it just executes the block for each value in the range.

In Rails, the default data structure for a data model is called, naturally enough, a model (the M in MVC from Section 1.3.3). The default Rails solution to the problem of persistence is to use a database for long-term data storage, and the default library for interacting with the database is called Active Record.1 Active Record comes with a host of methods for creating, saving, and finding data objects, all without having to use the structured query language (SQL)2 used by relational databases. Moreover, Rails has a feature called migrations to allow data definitions to be written in pure Ruby, without having to learn an SQL data definition language (DDL).

To understand a database index, it’s helpful to consider the analogy of a book index. In a book, to find all the occurrences of a given string, say “foobar”, you would have to scan each page for “foobar”—the paper version of a full-table scan. With a book index, on the other hand, you can just look up “foobar” in the index to see all the pages containing “foobar”.

Human and bonobo females copulate throughout menstrual cycle, as well as during lactation and pregnancy. Female chimps are sexually active only 25–40 percent of their cycle. Human and bonobo infants develop much more slowly than chimpanzees, beginning to play with others at about 1.5 years, much later than chimps. Like humans, female bonobos return to the group immediately after giving birth and copulate within months. They exhibit little fear of infanticide, which has never been observed in bonobos—captive or free-living. Bonobos and humans enjoy many different copulatory positions, with ventral-ventral (missionary position) appearing to be preferred by bonobo females and rear-entry by males, while chimps prefer rear-entry almost exclusively. Bonobos and humans often gaze into each other’s eyes when copulating and kiss each other deeply. Chimps do neither. The vulva is located between the legs and oriented toward the front of the body in humans and bonobos, rather than oriented toward the rear as in chimps and other primates. Food sharing is highly associated with sexual activity in humans and bonobos, only moderately so in chimps. There is a high degree of variability in potential sexual combinations in humans and bonobos; homosexual activity is common in both, but rare in chimps. Genital-genital (G-G) rubbing between female bonobos appears to affirm female bonding, is present in all bonobo populations studied (wild and captive), and is completely absent in chimpanzees. Human data on G-G rubbing are presently unavailable. (Attention: ambitious graduate students!) While sexual activity in chimps and other primates appears to be primarily reproductive, bonobos and humans utilize sexuality for social purposes (tension reduction, bonding, conflict resolution, entertainment, etc.).

One’s mojo, which has to be “working” to attract a lover, is Ki-Kongo for “soul.” Boogie comes from mbugi, meaning “devilishly good.” And both jazz and jism likely derive from dinza, the Ki-Kongo word for “to ejaculate.”

Far from being blinded by jealousy as the standard narrative predicts, men in these societies find themselves bound to one another by shared paternity for the children they’ve fathered together. As Beckerman explains, in the worst-case scenario, this system may provide extra security for the child: “You know that if you die, there’s some other man who has a residual obligation to care for at least one of your children. So looking the other way or even giving your blessing when your wife takes a lover is the only insurance you can buy.”6

Free-living Asian primates possess a characteristic I found shocking and confusing the first time I saw it: self-respect. If you make the mistake of holding the gaze of a street monkey in India, Nepal, or Malaysia, you’ll find you’re facing a belligerently intelligent creature whose expression says, with a Robert DeNiro–like scowl, “What the hell are you looking at? You wanna piece of me?”

They also married quite young, and to assure the bride’s fertility, she had to be filled with semen. On her wedding night, therefore, as many as ten members of her husband’s lineage had sexual intercourse with the bride, and if there were more men than this in the lineage, they had intercourse with her the following night….

Instead, observing a society where most of the men are lounging about relaxed and happy, they conclude they’ve found yet another patriarchy, thereby missing the point entirely.

Basic human reproductive biology in a foraging context made rapid population growth unlikely, if not impossible. Women rarely conceive while breastfeeding, and without milk from domesticated animals, hunter-gatherer women typically breastfeed each child for five or six years. Furthermore, the demands of a mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyle make carrying more than one small child at a time unreasonable for a mother—even assuming lots of help from others. Finally, low body-fat levels result in much later menarche for hunter-gatherer females than for their post-agricultural sisters. Most foragers don’t start ovulating until their late teens, resulting in a shorter reproductive life.

Hardin wrote, “The rational herdsman [will conclude] that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd.” This is the only rational choice because all will share the cost of the degradation to the land from overgrazing, while the profit gained from additional animals will be his alone. Since each individual herdsman will come to the same conclusion, the common ground will inevitably be overgrazed. “Freedom in a commons,” Hardin concluded, “brings ruin to us all.”

It’s likely that keeping population stable was more important to foragers than expanding it.

Early agriculture’s stores of harvested grain and herds of placid livestock were like boxes of bananas in the jungle. There was now something worth fighting over: more. More land to cultivate. More women to increase population to work the land, raise armies to defend it, and help with the harvest. More slaves for the hard labor of planting, harvesting, and fighting. Failed crops in one area would lead desperate farmers to raid neighbors, who would retaliate, and so on, over and over.24 Freedom (from war) is just another word for nothing to lose—or gain.

Take the average height of a full-grown man living in prehistoric times (using skeletal remains as a guide): about six feet tall (72 inches). Then take the average size of a prehistoric infant’s skeleton (let’s say about 20 inches). Then extrapolate from the ratio of infant-to-adult skeletons at known archaeological burial sites and presume that in general, for every three people who lived to adulthood, seven died as infants. Thus, owing to the high rate of infant mortality, average human height in prehistory was (3 × 72) + (7 × 20) ÷ 10 = 35.6 inches. Roughly three feet.1 Absurd? Yes. Misleading? Yup. Statistically accurate? Well, kinda. This height expectancy “truth” is no more absurd or misleading than what most people are led to believe about human life expectancy in prehistory.

Men produce only about one-third to one-eighth as much sperm per gram of spermatogenic tissue as eight other mammals tested.7 Researchers have noted similar surplus capacities in other aspects of human sperm and semen-production physiology.8 The correlation between infrequent ejaculation and various health problems offers further evidence that present-day men are not using their reproductive equipment to its fullest potential.

A team of Australian researchers, for example, found that men who had ejaculated more than five times per week between the ages of twenty and fifty were one-third less likely to develop prostate cancer later in life.

A team of Australian researchers, for example, found that men who had ejaculated more than five times per week between the ages of twenty and fifty were one-third less likely to develop prostate cancer later in life.9 Along with the fructose, potassium, zinc, and other benign components of semen, trace amounts of carcinogens are often present, so researchers hypothesize that the reduction in cancer rates may be due to the frequent flushing of the ducts. A different team from Sydney University reported in late 2007 that daily ejaculation dramatically reduced DNA damage to men’s sperm cells, thereby increasing male fertility—quite the opposite of the conventional wisdom. After forty-two men with damaged sperm were instructed to ejaculate daily for a week, almost all showed less chromosomal damage than a control group who had abstained for three days.

A female body in motion tends to stay in motion. But men come and go. For them, the curtain falls quickly and the mind turns to unrelated matters. This symmetry of dual disappointment illustrates the almost comical incompatibility between men’s and women’s sexual response in the context of monogamous mating.

“In a wide variety of species, females vocalize just before, during or immediately after they mate. These vocalizations,” Semple says, “are particularly common among the primates and evidence is now accumulating that by calling, a female incites males in her group….”4 Precisely. There’s a good reason the sound of a woman enjoying a sexual encounter entices a heterosexual man. Her “copulation call” is a potential invitation to come hither, thus provoking sperm competition.

Because of the complexities of how the two sets of parental DNA interact in fertilization, a man who appears to be of superior mate value (square jaw, symmetrical body, good job, firm handshake, Platinum AMEX card) may in fact be a poor genetic match for a particular woman. So, a woman (and ultimately, her child) may benefit by “sampling many males” and letting her body decide whose sperm fertilizes her.

In the early 1990s, neuroscientist Keith Kendrick and his colleagues exchanged that season’s newborn sheep and goats (the baby sheep were raised by adult goats, and vice versa). Upon reaching sexual maturity a few years later, the animals were reunited with their own species and their mating behavior was observed. The females adopted a love-the-one-you’re-with approach, showing themselves willing to mate with males of either species. But the males, even after being back with their own species for three years, would mate only with the species with which they were raised.

for men, both gay and straight, higher sex drive increases the specificity of their sexual desire. In other words, a straight guy with a higher sex drive tends to be more focused on women, while higher sex drive in a gay guy makes him more intent on men. But with women—at least nominally straight women—the opposite occurs: the higher her sex drive, the more likely she’ll be attracted to men and women.

To understand one possible motivation for returning the priority at the time of resumption, consider how the priority can be used to convey information. Suppose, for example, that a process needs to suspend until one of two events occurs. A programmer can assign a unique priority value to each event (e.g., priorities 25 and 26), and arrange the calls to resume to set the priority accordingly. The process can then use the priority to determine why it was resumed

We will see, for example, that a process in the ready, sleeping, or waiting states is stored on one of the linked lists in the queue structure, which means kill must dequeue the process. In the next chapter, we will see that if a process is waiting for a semaphore, kill must adjust the semaphore count

A process calls wait(s) to decrement the count of semaphore s, and signal(s) to increment the count. If the semaphore count becomes negative when a process executes wait(s), the process is temporarily blocked and placed in the semaphore’s set of blocked processes.

when signal is called on semaphore s, the semaphore count is incremented. In addition, the signal examines the process list associated with s. If the list is not empty (i.e., at least one process is waiting on the semaphore), signal extracts a process from the list and moves the process back to the ready list. A question arises: if multiple processes are waiting, which one should signal select? Several policies have been used: d Highest scheduling priority d First-come-first-served (longest waiting time) d Random

As with semdelete, semreset must be sure that no processes are already waiting on the semaphore. Thus, after checking its arguments and verifying that the semaphore exists, semreset iterates through the list of waiting processes, removing each from the semaphore queue and making the process ready to execute. As expected, semreset uses resched_cntl to defer rescheduling during the time processes are placed on the ready list.

The hardware needed for demand paging consists of a page table and an address translation unit. A page table resides in kernel memory, and there is one page table for each process. Typically, the hardware contains a register that points to the current page table and a second register that specifies the length; after it has created a page table in memory, the operating system assigns values to the registers and turns on demand paging. Similarly, when a context switch occurs, the operating system changes the page table registers to point to the page table for the new process

A real-time clock operates independent of the processor, and pulses in fractions of a second (e.g., 1000 times per second), generating an interrupt for each pulse. Usually, real-time clock hardware does not count pulses — if an operating system needs to compute an elapsed time, the system must increment a counter when each clock interrupt occurs

Technically, a time-of-day clock is a chronometer that computes elapsed time. The hardware consists of an internal real-time clock connected to a counter that tallies the pulses. Like a normal clock, the time can be changed. Once set, however, the mechanism runs independent of the processor, and continues as long as the system receives power (some units include a small battery to keep the clock active even if the external power is removed temporarily). Unlike other clocks, a time-of-day clock does not interrupt — the processor must set or interrogate the clock

In a concurrent programming system, no process should use the processor while waiting for another process. A process that executes instructions while waiting for another is said to engage in busy waiting. To understand our prohibition on busy waiting, think of the implementation. If a process uses the processor while waiting, the processor cannot be executing other processes. At best, the computation will be delayed unnecessarily, and at worst, the waiting process will use all the available processor cycles in a single-core system, and will wind up waiting forever

A semaphore consists of an integer value that is initialized when the semaphore is created and a set of zero or more processes that are waiting on the semaphore. The system call wait decrements a semaphore and adds the calling process to the set of waiting processes if the result is negative. The system call signal performs the opposite action by incrementing the semaphore and allowing one of the waiting process to continue, if any are waiting. To synchronize, a producer and consumer need two semaphores: one on which the consumer waits and one on which the producer waits

Open and close allow the operating system to manage devices that require exclusive use, prepare a device for data transfer, and stop a device after transfer has ended. Closing a device may be useful, for example, if a device needs to be powered down or placed in a standby state when not in use. Read and write handle the transfer of multiple data bytes to or from a buffer in memory. Getc and putc form a counterpart for the transfer of a single byte (usually a character). Control allows a program to control a device or a device driver (e.g. , to check supplies in a printer or select the channel on a wireless radio). Seek is a special case of control that applies to randomly accessible storage devices, such as disks.Finally, init initializes the device and driver at system startup

The UART device contains two onboard buffers, known as FIFOs. One FIFO handles incoming characters, and the other handles outgoing characters. Each FIFO holds up to sixteen characters. The device does not interrupt each time a character arrives. Instead, the hardware generates an interrupt when the first character arrives, but continues to add characters to the input FIFO if they arrive before the interrupt has been serviced. Thus, when it receives an input interrupt, the driver must repeatedly extract characters from the FIFO until the hardware FIFO is empty

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a mechanism that a computer can use to obtain an IP address, an address mask for the network, and the IP address of a default router. The computer broadcasts a request, and a DHCP server running on the network sends a response. Usually, DHCP is invoked at startup because the information must be obtained before normal Internet communication is possible

Function arp_resolve is called when an IP packet is ready to be sent. Arp_resolve takes two arguments: the first specifies the IP address of a computer for which an Ethernet address is needed; the second is a pointer to an array that will hold the Ethernet address. Although the code may seem complex, there are only three cases: the IP address is a broadcast address, the information is already in the ARP cache, or the information is not known. For an IP broadcast address, arp_resolve copies the Ethernet broadcast address into the array specified by the second argument. If the information is present in the cache, arp_resolve finds the correct entry, copies the Ethernet address from the entry into the caller’s array, and returns to the caller without sending any packets over the network. In the case where the requested mapping is not in the cache, arp_resolve must send packets over the network to obtain the information

If it finds the ARP packet type (0x806), netin calls function arp_in to handle the packet. Arp_in must handle two cases: either the packet is a request that was initiated by another computer or it is a reply, possibly to a request that we have sent. The protocol specifies that when either type of packet arrives, ARP must examine the sender’s information (IP address and Ethernet address), and update the local cache accordingly. If a process is waiting for the reply, arp_in sends a message to the process. Because an ARP request is broadcast, all computers on the network receive each request. Therefore, after it updates the sender’s information, arp_in checks the target IP address in a request to determine whether the request is for the local system or some other computer on the network. If the request is for another computer, arp_in returns without taking further action. If the target IP address in the incoming request matches the IP address of the local system, arp_in sends an ARP reply. Arp_in forms a reply in variable apkt. Once all fields of the packet have been filled in, the code calls write on the Ethernet device to transmit the reply back to the requester

It may seem that the check is unnecessary because the port will not be registered until rdscomm runs. However, checking at runtime allows the remote disk system to be restarted. Second, rdscomm checks to see whether the computer has already obtained an IP address (which is required for Internet communication).

Newqueue assigns the value EMPTY to unused pointers (i.e., the successor of the tail and the predecessor of the head). When it initializes a list, newqueue also sets the key fields in the head and the tail to the maximum and minimum integer values, respectively, with the assumption that neither value will be used as a key. Only one allocation function is needed because a list can be used to implement a FIFO queue or a priority queue. Once it finishes with initialization, newqueue returns the index of the list head to its caller. The caller only needs to store one value because the ID of the tail can be computed by adding 1 to the ID of the head

In source code, a system call appears to be a conventional function invocation. At runtime, however, a system call and a conventional function call differ. Instead of transferring control to another function, a system call transfers control to the operating system, which performs the requested service for the application. Taken as a set, system calls establish a well-defined boundary between applications and the underlying operating system that is known as an Application Program Interface (API

Du Mont invented the first commercial television set. Duryea introduced the first automobile. Hurley introduced the first washing machine. All are gone. Is something wrong with the law of leadership in chapter 1? No, but the law of the mind modifies it. It’s better to be first in the prospect’s mind than first in the marketplace. Which, if anything, understates the importance of being first in the mind. Being first in the mind is everything in marketing. Being first in the marketplace is important only to the extent that it allows you to get in the mind first. For example, IBM wasn’t first in the marketplace with the mainframe computer. Remington Rand was first, with UNIVAC. But thanks to a massive marketing effort, IBM got into the mind first and won the computer battle early. The law of the mind follows from the law of perception. If marketing is a battle of perception, not product, then the mind takes precedence over the marketplace.

Most people think they are better perceivers than others. They have a sense of personal infallibility. Their perceptions are always more accurate than those of their neighbors or friends. Truth and perception become fused in the mind, leaving no difference between the two. It’s not easy to see that this is so. To cope with the terrifying reality of being alone in the universe, people project themselves on the outside world. They “live” in the arena of books, movies, television, newspapers, magazines. They “belong” to clubs, organizations, institutions. These outside representations of the world seem more real than the reality inside their own minds. People cling firmly to the belief that reality is the world outside of the mind and that the individual is one small speck on a global spaceship. Actually it’s the opposite. The only reality you can be sure about is in your own perceptions. If the universe exists, it exists inside your own mind and the minds of others. That’s the reality that marketing programs must deal with.

What makes the battle even more difficult is that customers frequently make buying decisions based on second-hand perceptions. Instead of using their own perceptions, they base their buying decisions on someone else’s perception of reality. This is the “everybody knows” principle. Everybody knows that the Japanese make higher-quality cars than the Americans do. So people make buying decisions based on the fact that everybody knows the Japanese make higher-quality cars. When you ask shoppers whether they have had any personal experience with a product, most often they say they haven’t. And, more often than not, their own experience is often twisted to conform to their perceptions.

A market study showed that the most popular attribute for fast food was “fast” (no big surprise there). So Burger King did what most red-blooded marketers do. It turned to its advertising agency and said, “If the world wants fast, our advertising should tell them we’re fast.” What was overlooked in the research was that McDonald’s was already perceived as being the fastest hamburger chain in the country. Fast belonged to McDonald’s. Undaunted by this, Burger King launched its campaign with the slogan “Best food for fast times.” The program quickly became a disaster

The reader looked at the ad and wondered, How could they have the finest rent-a-car service when they’re not on the top rung of my ladder? Then Avis did the one thing you have to do to make progress inside the mind of the prospect. They acknowledged their position on the ladder. “Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars. So why go with us? We try harder.” For 13 years in a row, Avis had lost money. Then, when it admitted to being No. 2, it started to make money, lots of money.

Many marketing people have misread the Avis story. They assume the company was successful because it tried harder (i.e., it had the better service). But that wasn’t it at all. Avis was successful because it related itself to the position of Hertz in the mind.

How many rungs are there on your ladder? It depends on whether your product is a high-interest or a low-interest product. Products you use every day (cigarettes, cola, beer, toothpaste, cereal) tend to be high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders. Products that are purchased infrequently (furniture, lawn mowers, luggage) usually have few rungs on their ladders. Products that involve a great deal of personal pride (automobiles, watches, cameras) are also high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders even though they are purchased infrequently.

What’s the maximum number of rungs on a ladder? There seems to be a rule of seven in the prospect’s mind. Ask someone to name all the brands he or she remembers in a given category. Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category. According to Harvard psychologist Dr. George A. Miller, the average human mind cannot deal with more than seven units at a time.

Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite—inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power.

Be wary of friends—they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.

I don’t want you to think of “cooking” as one activity. Think of it as “prep,” things that can be done hours/days in advance, and “pickup,” or what you do when you decide it’s time to eat. This will greatly reduce feeling rushed. So remember: it’s no longer cooking, it’s prep and pickup.

In restaurants, the distinction between cook and chef is important: someone who can cook is a cook, whereas someone who can create a menu and run a kitchen is a chef. Calling yourself the latter when you’re the former, as many TV hosts do, is a no-no. In some circles, the cook is a technician, however good, and the chef is the conductor. The former is the bricklayer, the latter the architect of the cathedral.

I’d developed two simple lenses through which I viewed language-learning methods, and learning in general: Is the method effective? Have you narrowed down your material to the highest frequency? Is the method sustainable? Have you chosen a schedule and subject matter that you can stick with (or at least put up with) until reaching fluency? Will you actually swallow the pill you’ve prescribed yourself?

The darker green the vegetable, the more magnesium it contains. But if you boil it until it’s mushy, when you throw away the water, you throw away much of the magnesium. So here’s the key to getting enough magnesium from your diet. When you cook meat, capture the drippings and add it back as sauce. If you boil meat or bones, drink the broth or reduce it to make sauce. Steam vegetables rather than boiling them, and cook them until they are ‘al dente’ (to the tooth) rather than soft enough to eat without teeth. Do all of these things routinely and you’ll probably get enough magnesium from your diet without supplements.

It is a common mistake for people to assume that your intake of saturates is what determines your blood level of this much maligned nutrient, but this is incorrect. Particularly in the keto-adapted state, fat is being burned at a much higher rate, and this is particularly true for saturated fat. In two recently published studies we showed that a low carbohydrate, high fat diet significantly decreased circulating levels of saturated fat[23, 59]. It’s hard to imagine how dietary saturated fat can be problematic when it is promptly burned to carbon dioxide and water.

The clinical importance of consuming a lower omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is well established[60], but there are additional reasons why athletes may benefit. Omega-6 fats are more strongly associated with inflammation than omega-3 fats. Increasing omega-3 status consistently leads to lower levels of inflammation, and it also has a potent effect on lowering fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood.

the human system doesn’t seem to tolerate a high fat diet prepared from high omega-6 oils (like soy and corn oils), but does just fine on one consisting mostly of monounsaturated and saturated fats (e.g., olive oil and animal fats). This doesn’t mean you can’t eat mayo, just find one made from olive or canola oil or make your own. And please, don’t be fooled by the ag-industry advertising that touts high PUFA oils as being heart healthy. While this message might have some validity for someone eating a very low fat diet, at the high fat end of the dietary fat spectrum, it is completely invalid (if not dangerous).

If you’re naturally uncomfortable in large social gatherings, the next time you’re at a party, don’t force yourself to be sociable right away or to be “on” for the whole evening. Instead, try these easy tweaks. Give yourself five minutes after you arrive to hang back and observe. Then give yourself little “introversion breaks” during the party: five-minute pockets of solitude. I know one highly charismatic introvert who often does exactly that during both social and business events. When she reemerges to mingle, people frequently comment on how radiant she is.

Choosing the right charisma style depends on your personality, goals, and the situation.  You can alternate among different charisma styles or even blend them together. Don’t force yourself into a charisma style that is just too awkward for you. Doing so would negatively affect how you feel and how others perceive you.  The more charisma styles you can access, the more versatile and confident you will be.  Stretch out of your comfort zone in low-stakes situations.  Stick with styles you already know well in high-stakes situations.  Let goodwill be your safety net. Coming from a place of genuine goodwill gives you the best chance of getting your charisma right.

In one study conducted at the University of Texas at Austin, people were able to accurately judge nine out of ten personality traits by looking at a single photograph.

When they were dressed in the same style as the student, the student said yes two-thirds of the time. When they were dressed in the opposite style, the student said yes less than half the time.6 One company that understood this principle and used it to its advantage was American Express.

First things first: make sure your right hand is free. Shift anything it may be holding to your left hand well in advance. You don’t want to have to fumble at the last moment. Avoid holding a drink in your right hand, especially if it’s a cold drink, as the condensation will make your hand feel cold and clammy. Before shaking someone’s hand, whether you are a man or a woman, rise if you’re seated. And keep your hands out of your pockets: visible hands make you look more open and honest. Make sure to use plenty of eye contact, and smile warmly but briefly: too much smiling could make you appear overeager. Keep your head straight, without tilting it in any way, and face the person fully. Keep your hand perfectly perpendicular, neither dominant (palm down) nor submissive (palm up). If you’re in doubt, angle your thumb straight to the ceiling. Open wide the space between your thumb and index finger to make sure you get optimal thumb-web contact. Ensure contact between the palms of your hands by keeping your palm flat—not cupped—and by draping your hand across your partner’s diagonally. Try to wrap your fingers around your partner’s hand, scaling them one by one, as if you were giving a hug with your hand. You will almost have your index finger on their pulse—almost, but not quite. Once full contact is made, lock your thumb down and squeeze firmly, about as much as your partner does. Shake from the elbow (not the wrist), linger for a moment if you want to convey particular warmth, and step back.

People feel most comfortable with those who are similar to them in some way, including appearance and behavior. Do your homework and decide how much you want to adapt your dress and word choice to your environment.  A good handshake can go a long way. Likewise, a bad one can leave an unfavorable and lasting first impression. It’s worth spending some time perfecting the right way to greet someone.

When you want to increase your poise, there are three major issues to look out for. The first is excessive or rapid nodding. Nodding once for emphasis or to express agreement is fine and can be an effective communication method, but nodding three or four times in rapid succession is not. This is what one of my clients has come to call “the bobble head.” The second hindrance is excessive verbal reassurance: making a sound, such as “uh-huh,” or a half-sentence, such as “Oh, I agree.” Done once, and consciously, this is fine; multiple times per sentence is not. The third issue is restlessness or fidgeting (tapping your pencil or foot, or rearranging items on the table). Fidgeting decreases presence, thus charisma. Even when you have warmth, confidence, and are mentally present, if you are physically restless, you can’t be charismatic. Your body language is sending distracting signals.

To communicate warmth, aim to make people feel comfortable: respect their personal space, mirror their body language, and keep your eyes relaxed.  When people come to you in need of reassurance, first mirror their body language, then lead them to more calm, open, and confident positions.  When people are defensive, break their body language lock by handing them something to look at or something they will have to lean forward to take.  To project power, take up space (be the big gorilla) and be still (adopt a regal posture).  Cut out verbal and nonverbal reassurances like head bobbing and excessive uh-huh-ing.

Find ways to remind them of any help they’ve given you in the past. Express your appreciation and gratitude, highlight the choice they made, the effort they put in; and if they put their reputation on the line for you in any way, play it up.

The very next time you’re in a conversation, try to regularly check whether your mind is fully engaged or whether it is wandering elsewhere (including preparing your next sentence). Aim to bring yourself back to the present moment as often as you can by focusing on your breath or your toes for just a second, and then get back to focusing on the other person.

Charismatic speakers know how to give the impression that they’re as comfortable walking across the stage as they would be walking across their living room. This is called owning the stage, and there are three tricks to making it happen. First, when you stand, be sure to have a wide stance, well balanced on both feet. Not only will you feel more confident, you’ll also look more confident, more stable, than if you were standing on one foot. Wide, stable stances also help you to project confidence. Be the gorilla! Second, practice without a podium or a lectern. Speaking behind one can give the impression that you’re fearful to venture out, and prefer staying behind the safety of a shield. It also makes the presentation much more static. Think of the stereotype of a boring presentation: a lecturer who stands immobile at his lectern, reading from his notes in a monotone voice. Moving comfortably around the stage will make you appear much more confident, powerful, and charismatic. Third, find the right volume to project confidence. This is tricky, as so much can depend on the microphone you’re given that day or how the sound system is set up. Your best bet is, just before the speech, to ask a few people sitting in the back of the room to be your sound experts and give you a prearranged signal to raise or lower your volume if need be.

Because charismatic people seem endowed with extra powers, we expect more of them than we do of others.

Charisma has three essential components: presence, power, and warmth.  Being present—paying attention to what’s going on rather than being caught up in your thoughts—can yield immense rewards. When you exhibit presence, those around you feel listened to, respected, and valued.  Because your body language telegraphs your internal state to those around you, in order to be charismatic—to exhibit presence, power, and warmth—you must display charismatic body language.  Because your mind can’t tell the difference between imagination and reality, by creating a charismatic internal state your body language will authentically display charisma.  In terms of achieving charisma, your internal state is critical. Get the internal state right, and the right charismatic behaviors and body language will pour forth automatically.

Any internal discomfort—either physical or mental—can impair how you feel, how you perform, and how others perceive you.  Physical tension caused by something as simple as the sun in your eyes produces the same changes in body language as a more serious discomfort, like anxiety or irritation.  Prevention is optimal: plan ahead to ensure comfort in clothing, location, and timing.  Aim to stay aware of any physical sensation of discomfort. If physical discomfort arises during an interaction, act promptly to alleviate or explain it.  Use techniques such as the responsibility transfer to reduce the feelings of anxiety, uncertainty, and dissatisfaction that play out in your body language and inhibit your charisma.  Understand that mental negativity such as anxiety, dissatisfaction, self-criticism, or self-doubt is normal and something that everyone experiences.

The next time you think you see coldness or reservation in someone’s face while they’re talking to you, try to remember that it could simply be the visible signs of their internal discomfort. You might be catching the surface tremors of an internal tempest, and there’s a good chance that it has nothing to do with how they feel about you or what you’ve just said. This reminder helps me on a regular basis. When I’m involved in a conversation and I catch a tone of annoyance or impatience in someone’s voice, or when I see a fleeting negative expression cross their face, sometimes I still feel instinctively dismayed. It’s hard not to assume that what I’ve just seen is a reaction to what I’ve just said. But right on the heels of this instinctive reaction comes the recognition that whatever I’ve seen may well be the sign of how they’re feeling about themselves, an itchy wool suit, or something else entirely.

When your brain spins negative scenarios, remind yourself that you may not be getting an accurate perception of reality. Your brain might be following its negativity bias, playing up some elements more than others, or omitting some positives entirely.

Depersonalize the experience. Rather than saying “I’m feeling ashamed,” try “There is shame being felt.” Imagine that you’re a scientist observing a phenomenon: “How interesting, there are self-critical thoughts arising.”

One author friend reminded me of a maxim called Parkinson’s Law: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” He challenged me: “Rather than letting the writing process fill the entire year, try to write the entire book in one month. At the end of a month, what you have will certainly not be a finished book, but it’ll be more than you would have without this self-imposed deadline.” This seemed sensible, so I decided to give it a try. I imagined—as vividly as possible, with sensory-rich details—that my publisher had somehow given me an insane one-month deadline to write the entire book. And I was amazed at how fast this completely imaginary deadline became emotionally real. I even felt a knot in the pit of my stomach, a physical reminder that the clock was ticking. Was this pleasant? Definitely not. Effective? Absolutely

Think of one person in your life who has aggrieved you. ♦ Take a blank page and write that person a letter saying anything and everything you wish you had ever told them. Really get into this—you have nothing to lose. Make sure you write it out by hand. ♦ When you’ve gotten absolutely everything off your mind and onto paper, put the letter aside. ♦ Take a fresh sheet and write their response just the way you wish they would respond. You might have them taking responsibility for their actions, acknowledging and apologizing for everything they’ve ever done that hurt you. You don’t need to find any justification for their actions, just an acknowledgment and an apology. It’s your imagination, so you get to decide exactly what you’d like to hear. This exercise may feel alien, awkward, or unreal at first—that’s the case for many people. And you may not feel an immediate internal shift. However, over the next few days you may be amazed to feel this “new reality” gradually taking hold. You may feel that you did get the closure you needed. To accelerate the process, simply reread the apology letter nightly for a few days.

Though it sounds counterintuitive, rather than trying to suppress, ignore, or power through them, your goal is to give your full attention to the very sensations you’d instinctively want to push away. Focusing on the minute sensations of your physical discomfort serves a dual purpose: it gives your mind something concrete to focus on other than its growing conviction that this situation is unbearable. It also has the advantage of bringing you instantly into full presence, a key component of charisma. In fact, this technique, called delving into sensations, can help you access charismatic presence even during highly uncomfortable situations.

Skillfully handle internal discomfort with a three-step process: destigmatize your discomfort, neutralize your negative thoughts, and rewrite your perception of reality.  Destigmatize and dedramatize uncomfortable feelings by remembering that they are survival instincts and a natural part of the human experience. Think of others who’ve gone through this before—especially people you admire—and see yourself as part of a community of human beings experiencing the same feeling at the same moment.  Neutralize unhelpful negative thoughts by remembering that the mind often distorts reality and filters your environment to highlight the negative. Think of your negative thoughts as graffiti on a wall—you may find it an ugly sight, but just because you see an ugly sight doesn’t mean you’re an ugly person.  Rewrite reality by considering a few helpful alternatives to your current perspective. For maximum effect, write down your new realities by hand and describe them in vivid detail.

Have you ever felt flooded with relief after finding an important item you thought had been lost or stolen? (It happens to me every time I lose my keys.) This instinctive sweeping sense of gratitude can be remarkably powerful, and it taps into wells of gratitude deeper than almost any other practice. You can manufacture this gratitude-producing sense of relief by imagining your own funeral.

One simple but effective way to start is to try to find three things you like about the person you want to feel goodwill toward. No matter whom it is you’re talking to, find three things to appreciate or approve of—even if these are as small as “their shoes are shined” or “they were on time.” When you start searching for positive elements, your mental state changes accordingly and then sweeps through your body language.

three key concepts: Self-confidence is our belief in our ability to do or to learn how to do something. Self-esteem is how much we approve of or value ourselves. It’s often a comparison-based evaluation (whether measured against other people or against our own internal standards for approval). Self-compassion is how much warmth we can have for ourselves, especially when we’re going through a difficult experience.

Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take two or three deep breaths. As you inhale, imagine drawing in masses of clean air toward the top of your head; then let it whoosh through you from head to toe as you exhale, washing all concerns away. ♦ Think of any occasion in your life when you performed a good deed, however great or small. Just one good action—one moment of truth, generosity, or courage. Focus on that memory for a moment. ♦ Now think of one being, whether present or past, mythical or actual—Jesus, Buddha, Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama—who could have great affection for you. This could be a person, a pet, or even a stuffed animal. ♦ Picture this being in your mind. Imagine their warmth, their kindness and compassion. See it in their eyes and face. Feel their warmth radiating toward you, enveloping you. ♦ See yourself through their eyes with warmth, kindness, and compassion. Feel them giving you complete forgiveness for everything your inner critic says is wrong. You are completely and absolutely forgiven. You have a clean slate. ♦ Feel them giving you wholehearted acceptance. You are accepted as you are, right now, at this stage of growth, imperfections and all. You are perfect. At this stage of development, you are perfect. At this stage of growth, you are perfect. At this stage of perfection, you are perfect.

To make visualizations most effective, vividly engage all five senses in your imagination.  You can increase both warmth and confidence by practicing gratitude, goodwill, and compassion for others as well as for yourself.  Just as professional athletes and performers do, plan a gradual warm-up to reach your peak charismatic performance. Before important events, avoid experiences that would impair your mental state and plan warmth- and confidence-boosting activities instead.  Your body affects your mind. Flip the visualization technique on its head and practice adopting the right posture and facial expressions to access more of almost any desired internal state.

I lie.” “The other day, when we spoke, you had a way of putting it that I thought was very interesting and succinct. Can you tell us all what you said?” “I said that secrets are lies.” “Secrets are lies. It’s very memorable.

We behave worse when we’re not accountable. That goes without saying. And second, secrets inspire speculation. When we don’t know what’s being hidden, we guess, we make up answers.” “Well that’s interesting, isn’t it?” Bailey turned to the audience. “When we can’t reach a loved one, we speculate. We panic. We make up stories about where they are or what’s happened to them. And if we’re feeling ungenerous, or jealous, we make up lies. Sometimes some very damaging lies. We assume they’re doing something nefarious. All because we don’t know something.” “It’s like when we see two people whispering,” Mae said. “We worry, we feel insecure, we make up terrible things they might be saying.

She knew she was approaching a few phrases she needed to get right. She’d said them in Bailey’s library, and she just needed to say them again the way she’d first said them. “For example, if there’s a locked door, I start to make up all kinds of stories about what might be behind it. I feel like it’s some kind of secret, and it leads to me making up lies. But if all the doors are open, physically and metaphorically, there’s only the one truth.” Bailey smiled. She’d nailed it.

Every day she’d done without things she didn’t want to want. Things she didn’t need. She’d given up soda, energy drinks, processed foods. At Circle social events, she nursed one drink only, and tried each time to leave it unfinished. Anything immoderate would provoke a flurry of zings of concern, so she stayed within the bounds of moderation. And she found it freeing. She was liberated from bad behavior. She was liberated from doing things she didn’t want to be doing, eating and drinking things that did her no good. Since she’d gone transparent, she’d become more noble. People called her a role model.

Most papers have little chance of replacing their traditional business with an online alternative. As a result, every day at most papers is going to be just a little bit worse than the day before. Every day you stay is a bad strategic decision for your career because every day you get better at something that isn’t that useful—and you are another day behind others who are learning something more useful. The only reason to stay is the short-term pain associated with quitting. Winners understand that taking that pain now prevents a lot more pain later. The same applies to the strategic management of organizations. The decision to quit or not is a simple evaluation: Is the pain of the Dip worth the benefit of the light at the end of the tunnel?

So, given this overhead cost, it’s far better to zoom out and make a few big generic decisions that can apply to a large number of specific situations, to find a pattern within—in short, to go from chaos to concept.

In one business, the market research man may have a staff of two hundred people, whereas the market research man of the closest competitor is all by himself and has only a secretary for his staff. This should make little difference in the contribution expected of the two men. It is an administrative detail. Two hundred people, of course, can do a great deal more work than one man. But it does not follow that they produce and contribute more. Knowledge work is not defined by quantity. Neither is knowledge work defined by its costs. Knowledge work is defined by its results. And for these, the size of the group and the magnitude of the managerial job are not even symptoms.

An established industry full of existing winners running on greed is like the highest layer of trees in a crowded rainforest. They’ll push upward only as needed, elbowing each other for little gains and victories as they vie for sunlight, mostly just trying to keep their spot in the canopy. Greed just wants sunlight—it doesn’t care how high up it is when it gets it. But below, the hungry underdog burns for sunlight and will spend 100 hours a week trying to figure out how to get it. When the breakthrough comes, the underdog bursts up through the canopy into the open sky and spreads its leaves out wide. Suddenly, the trees that had been on top are blocked from the sun. Greed is then replaced by the much more powerful drive of survival, and innovation kicks into high gear as they scramble upwards for their life. The environment has changed—it’s been disrupted—and in this new world, created by the underdog disruptor, companies have to innovate in order to re-optimize.

If a floor you hit is one or more first principles that represent the truth of reality or your inner self and the logic going upwards stays accurate to that foundation, you’re in the lab. If a Why? pathway hits a floor called “Because [authority] said so”—if you go down and down and realize at the bottom that the whole thing is just because you’re taking your parent’s or friend’s or religion’s or society’s word for it—then you’re in church there.

He thinks he has become wise to the farce of letting dogma dictate your life, but he’s actually in the grasp of dogma’s slickest trick. Humans are programmed to take fear very seriously, and evolution didn’t find it efficient to have us assess and re-assess every fear inside of us. It went instead with the “better safe than sorry” philosophy—i.e. if there’s a chance that a certain fear might be based on real danger, file it away as a real fear, just in case, and even if you confirm later that a fear of yours has no basis, keep it with you, just in case. Better safe than sorry. And the fear file cabinet is somewhere way down in our psyches—somewhere far below our centers of rationality, out of reach.

But even though its doors are always open, most people never set foot in it for the same reason so many Americans never visit some of the world’s most interesting countries—because of an incorrect assumption that it’s a dangerous place.

The second major problem for Self-Loathing Cook is that, like all cooks, he can’t wrap his head around the fact that he’s the scientist in the lab—not the experiment. As we established earlier, conscious tribe members reach conclusions, while blind tribe members are conclusions. And what you believe, what you stand for, and what you choose to do each day are conclusions that you’ve drawn.

That respect is in our wiring, and the only way to weaken it is by defying it and seeing, when nothing bad ends up happening, that most of the fear you’ve been feeling has just been a smoke and mirrors act.

But such occasional HIWTYL improvisations are far too unpredictable and unsystematic for Sociopath tastes. For them, HIWTYL is not about hacking reward/penalty structures after the fact. It is about proactively engineering systems and processes that reliably, predictably and stealthily generate HIWTYL outcomes. In other words, they look for ways to systematically claim paternity for successes, and orphan failures.

The second key feature of Loser groups is that they naturally apportion credit for successes and failures in ways that don’t balance the books. To work the Clueless, you need a Hanlon Dodge to get to reduced charges. With the Losers, something similar happens naturally.  Here’s why: Losers will accept blame, but only in inverse proportion to their self-perceived status. Due to the murkiness of collective responsibility, and the effect of status illegibility, self-perceived status is the only available basis for dividing up credit or blame. If everybody believes they are above average (with everybody else supporting that delusion, as we saw last time), they will assign more of the blame to others and less to themselves, and convince themselves that their partitioning of blame is fair.

MacLeod’s Loser layer had me puzzled for a long time, because I was interpreting it in cultural terms: the kind of person you call a “loser.” While some may be losers in that sense too, they are primarily losers in the economic sense: those who have, for various reasons, made (or been forced to make) a bad economic bargain. They’ve given up some potential for long-term economic liberty (as capitalists) for short-term economic stability. Traded freedom for a paycheck, in short. They actually produce, but are not compensated in proportion to the value they create (since their compensation is set by Sociopaths operating under conditions of serious moral hazard).

Small minds discuss people, average minds discuss events. In Jamesian solitude, the minds of Losers turn to endlessly reliving social events and the associated churn of status and emotions. The banal sorrows and pleasures of group life, which we saw in Part IV, are endlessly reviewed for significance in private.  The external consequence of such private processing of intangibles is emotional resolution that heals or creates rifts.

divide-and-conquer is the most effective means for dealing with them, since it naturally creates emotional drama that keeps them busy while they are being manipulated.

At one point, Peter asks Lawrence what he would do if he had a million dollars, the classic “fuck you money” question.  Lawrence replies promptly, “two chicks at the same time, man!” revealing the simple unreconstructed hedonism that drives life in the delinquent class.  When Lawrence asks Peter the same question in turn, Peter replies, “Nothing. Relax, sit on my ass all day. I would do nothing.” To this, Lawrence offers a prompt comeback, pregnant with childlike wisdom: “Well, you don’t need a million dollars to do nothing!”  This is the central cognitive dissonance in Peter’s life: there is literally nothing keeping him trapped in his gridlock script, not even money.

A Loser who can be suckered into bad bargains is set to become one of the Clueless. That’s why they are promoted: they are worth even more as Clueless pawns in the middle than as direct producers at the bottom, where the average, rationally-disengaged Loser will do. At the bottom, the overperformers can merely add a predictable amount of value. In the middle they can be used by the Sociopaths to escape the consequences of high-risk machinations like re-orgs.

His trademark joke, “That’s what she said!” is an extreme example. It makes no sense in most contexts where he trots it out; its only purpose is to dissolve tension and displace threats. Either laughing with Michael or throwing up your hands in frustration is a victory for him. The only effective response is to calmly ignore his disruptive actions, wait for the reaction to die down, and continue the conversation in dominant mode, like Cesar Milan with his dogs. If you attempt to make sense of it, you’ve already lost. As Cesar Milan tells Mrs. Cartman, “Do not reason with it, do not argue with it, just dominate it.”

Marx provides the core idea we need in his famous line, “I don’t care to belong to any club that will have me as a member.”  There is a deep truth here. Social clubs of any sort divide the world into an us and a them. We are better than them. Any prospective new member who could raise the average prestige of a club is, by definition, somebody who is too good for that club.

Loser superiority is generally not based on an outright falsehood. Unlike Michael’s pretensions to comic genius, which are strictly not true, Pam really is the best artist in the group. The delusion lies not in a false assessment of her artistic skills, but in the group choosing to evaluate her on the basis of art in the first place.  In other words, Losers are too smart to fool themselves. They enter into social contracts which require them to fool each other.

investors were delighted to earn 11% on bank certificates of deposit (CDs) in 1980 and are bitterly disappointed to be earning only around 2% in 2003—even though they were losing money after inflation back then but are keeping up with inflation now. The nominal rate we earn is printed in the bank’s ads and posted in its window, where a high number makes us feel good. But inflation eats away at that high number in secret. Instead of taking out ads, inflation just takes away our wealth. That’s why inflation is so easy to overlook—and why it’s so important to measure your investing success not just by what you make, but by how much you keep after inflation.

Short-term or long-term? Bonds and interest rates teeter on opposite ends of a seesaw: If interest rates rise, bond prices fall—although a short-term bond falls far less than a long-term bond. On the other hand, if interest rates fall, bond prices rise—and a long-term bond will outper-forms shorter ones.8 You can split the difference simply by buying intermediate-term bonds maturing in five to 10 years—which do not soar when their side of the seesaw rises, but do not slam into the ground either.

The ideal way to dollar-cost average is into a portfolio of index funds, which own every stock or bond worth having. That way, you renounce not only the guessing game of where the market is going but which sectors of the market—and which particular stocks or bonds within them—will do the best.

According to Ibbotson Associates, the leading financial research firm, if you had invested $12,000 in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index at the beginning of September 1929, 10 years later you would have had only $7,223 left. But if you had started with a paltry $100 and simply invested another $100 every single month, then by August 1939, your money would have grown to $15,571! That’s the power of disciplined buying—even in the face of the Great Depression and the worst bear market of all time.

The enterprising investor under today’s conditions still has various possibilities of achieving better than average results. The huge list of marketable securities must include a fair number that can be identified as undervalued by logical and reasonably dependable standards. These should yield more satisfactory results on the average than will the DJIA or any similarly representative list. In our view the search for these would not be worth the investor’s effort unless he could hope to add, say, 5% before taxes to the average annual return from the stock portion of his portfolio.

Alternatively, I could allow ego to reign, keep street racing, and boast, “I’ll never lose another race again!” While the consequences of our choices can’t be manipulated, you can manipulate your memories to serve you.

Iteration is a profitable, singles-based business scaled to home runs. Franchising is another example of II. If you build a small store with the goal of intentional iteration, your goal isn’t one store, but hundreds, perhaps thousands, through the act of chaining or franchising.

As a business without one, you’re adrift in a sea of me-too businesses without a rudder, unmoored to the trade winds of the marketplace. USP-less businesses offer nothing distinct, nothing unique, no benefit, no logical reason that someone should buy from them other than hope or circumstance wrapped around a cheap price.

Think about the last time you bought a pack of gum. Did you fret over the price? Did you ask, “Hmmm, can I afford this?” Probably not. You bought the gum and it’s done. The purchase had no impact on your lifestyle or your future choices. To a rich man who walks into a dealership and buys a six-figure Bentley without thought, the acts are the same. Affordability is when you don’t have to think about it. If you have to think about “affordability,” you can’t afford it because affordability carries conditions and consequences. If you buy a boat and resort to mental gymnastics over affordability, YOU CAN’T AFFORD IT.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Money doesn’t buy happiness because money is used for consumer pursuits destructive to freedom. Anything destructive to freedom is destructive to the wealth trinity. Money, properly used, can buy freedom, which can lead to happiness. Happiness stems from good health, freedom, and strong interpersonal relationships, not necessarily money. Lifestyle Servitude steals freedom, and what steals freedom, steals wealth. If you think you can afford it, you can’t. The consequence of instant gratification is the destruction of freedom, health, and choice.

It had been 7 years since my car accident, and while this belief was based on my reality then, it was time to let it go. Maybe my memory was so horrible, at least in part, because I had never made the effort to believe it could improve. As Henry Ford said, “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right either way.” If affirmations could change what was, to me, the most justified limiting belief that I had, then they could probably change anything. So, I created my first affirmation which read: I am letting go of the limiting belief that I have a horrible memory. My brain is a miraculous organism capable of healing itself, and my memory can improve, but only in proportion to how much I believe it can improve. So, from this moment on, I am maintaining the unwavering belief that I have an excellent memory, and it’s continuing to get better every day.

This famous quote from Marianne Williamson’s bestselling book, A Return To Love, may resonate with anyone who feels mental or emotional obstacles when attempting to visualize:  “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.”

Those experts are partly correct. It does take 21 days—the first two phases—to form a new habit. But the third 10-day phase is crucial to sustaining your new habit, long term. The final 10 days is where you positively reinforce and associate pleasure with your new habit. You’ve been primarily associating pain and discomfort with it during the first 20 days. Instead of hating and resisting your new habit, you start feeling proud of yourself for making it this far. Phase Three is also where the actual transformation occurs, as your new habit becomes part of your identity. It transcends the space between something you’re trying and who you’re becoming. You start to see yourself as someone who lives the habit.

If you want to start running each morning, it’s essential that you choose a simple cue (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (such as a midday treat, a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles, or the endorphin rush you get from a jog). But countless studies have shown that a cue and a reward, on their own, aren’t enough for a new habit to last. Only when your brain starts expecting the reward—craving the endorphins or sense of accomplishment—will it become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, must also trigger a craving for the reward to come.

Emotion arises at the place where mind and body meet. It is the body’s reaction to your mind — or you might say, a reflection of your mind in the body.

To watch an emotion in this way is basically the same as listening to or watching a thought, which I described earlier. The only difference is that, while a thought is in your head, an emotion has a strong physical component and so is primarily felt in the body.

Pleasure is always derived from something outside you, whereas joy arises from within. The very thing that gives you pleasure today will give you pain tomorrow, or it will leave you, so its absence will give you pain. And what is often referred to as love may be pleasurable and exciting for a while, but it is an addictive clinging, an extremely needy condition that can turn into its opposite at the flick of a switch.

medium-size sites can sometimes negotiate to have the regional spares kit stored on their site, with the benefit that the technician is more likely to hang out near your building. Sometimes, it is possible to negotiate direct access to the spares kit on an emergency basis. (Usually, this is done without the knowledge of the technician’s management.)

"It works now, better leave well enough alone...." It's easy to be fooled by this line of thought. Why should you take the risk of messing with something that's working? Well, we can think of several reasons: It may not really be working—it might just look like it is. The boundary condition you rely on may be just an accident. In different circumstances (a different screen resolution, perhaps), it might behave differently. Undocumented behavior may change with the next release of the library. Additional and unnecessary calls make your code slower. Additional calls also increase the risk of introducing new bugs of their own.

Take short, deliberate steps: move a field from one class to another, fuse two similar methods into a superclass. Refactoring often involves making many localized changes that result in a larger-scale change. If you keep your steps small, and test after each step, you will avoid prolonged debugging.

Policies change regularly, so we probably don't want to hardwire them into our requirements. Our recommendation is to document these policies separately from the requirement, and hyperlink the two. Make the requirement the general statement, and give the developers the policy information as an example of the type of thing they'll need to support in the implementation. Eventually, policy may end up as metadata in the application.

That's why, when faced with a "surprising" failure, you must realize that one or more of your assumptions is wrong. Don't gloss over a routine or piece of code involved in the bug because you "know" it works. Prove it.

Debugging Checklist Is the problem being reported a direct result of the underlying bug, or merely a symptom? Is the bug really in the compiler? Is it in the OS? Or is it in your code? If you explained this problem in detail to a coworker, what would you say? If the suspect code passes its unit tests, are the tests complete enough? What happens if you run the unit test with this data? Do the conditions that caused this bug exist anywhere else in the system?

Avoid global data. Every time your code references global data, it ties itself into the other components that share that data. Even globals that you intend only to read can lead to trouble (for example, if you suddenly need to change your code to be multithreaded). In general, your code is easier to understand and maintain if you explicitly pass any required context into your modules. In object-oriented applications, context is often passed as parameters to objects' constructors. In other code, you can create structures containing the context and pass around references to them.

It’s easy to overlook them because when you look at them, they seem insignificant. They’re not big, sweeping things that take huge effort. They’re not heroic or dramatic. Mostly they’re just little things you do every day and that nobody else even notices.

There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerges. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances.

“With great power comes great responsibility.” It is true. But there’s a better version of this quote, a version that actually is profound, and all you have to do is switch the nouns around: “With great responsibility comes great power.” The more we choose to accept responsibility in our lives, the more power we will exercise over our lives. Accepting responsibility for our problems is thus the first step to solving them.

There’s a difference between blaming someone else for your situation and that person’s actually being responsible for your situation. Nobody else is ever responsible for your situation but you. Many people may be to blame for your unhappiness, but nobody is ever responsible for your unhappiness but you. This is because you always get to choose how you see things, how you react to things, how you value things. You always get to choose the metric by which to measure your experiences.

we don’t actually know what a positive or negative experience is. Some of the most difficult and stressful moments of our lives also end up being the most formative and motivating. Some of the best and most gratifying experiences of our lives are also the most distracting and demotivating. Don’t trust your conception of positive/negative experiences. All that we know for certain is what hurts in the moment and what doesn’t. And that’s not worth much.

perhaps the answer is to trust yourself less. After all, if our hearts and minds are so unreliable, maybe we should be questioning our own intentions and motivations more. If we’re all wrong, all the time, then isn’t self-skepticism and the rigorous challenging of our own beliefs and assumptions the only logical route to progress?

At the time it was assumed that people did bad things because they felt horrible about themselves—that is, they had low self-esteem. One of Baumeister’s first surprising findings was that this was often not true. In fact, it was usually the opposite. Some of the worst criminals felt pretty damn good about themselves. And it was this feeling good about themselves in spite of the reality around them that gave them the sense of justification for hurting and disrespecting others.

And it’s in these moments of insecurity, of deep despair, that we become susceptible to an insidious entitlement: believing that we deserve to cheat a little to get our way, that other people deserve to be punished, that we deserve to take what we want, and sometimes violently. It’s the backwards law again: the more you try to be certain about something, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel. But the converse is true as well: the more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know.

It can close you off to inner potential and outer opportunities. I say don’t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.

Question #2: What would it mean if I were wrong? Many people are able to ask themselves if they’re wrong, but few are able to go the extra step and admit what it would mean if they were wrong. That’s because the potential meaning behind our wrongness is often painful. Not only does it call into question our values, but it forces us to consider what a different, contradictory value could potentially look and feel like.

involve tangible external goals outside of our control. The pursuit of these goals causes great anxiety. And even if we manage to achieve them, they leave us feeling empty and lifeless, because once they’re achieved there are no more problems to solve. Better values, as we saw, are process-oriented. Something like “Express myself honestly to others,” a metric for the value “honesty,” is never completely finished; it’s a problem that must continuously be reengaged. Every new conversation, every new relationship, brings new challenges and opportunities for honest expression. The value is an ongoing, lifelong process that defies completion.

Many people, when they feel some form of pain or anger or sadness, drop everything and attend to numbing out whatever they’re feeling. Their goal is to get back to “feeling good” again as quickly as possible, even if that means substances or deluding themselves or returning to their shitty values. Learn to sustain the pain you’ve chosen. When you choose a new value, you are choosing to introduce a new form of pain into your life. Relish it. Savor it. Welcome it with open arms.

Death scares us. And because it scares us, we avoid thinking about it, talking about it, sometimes even acknowledging it, even when it’s happening to someone close to us.

Becker’s argument is this: We are all aware on some level that our physical self will eventually die, that this death is inevitable, and that its inevitability—on some unconscious level—scares the shit out of us. Therefore, in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our physical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever. This is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings, on statues, on spines of books. It’s why we feel compelled to spend so much time giving ourselves to others, especially to children, in the hopes that our influence—our conceptual self—will last way beyond our physical self. That we will be remembered and revered and idolized long after our physical self ceases to exist. Becker called such efforts our “immortality projects,” projects that allow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical death. All of human civilization, he says, is basically a result of immortality projects: the cities and governments and structures and authorities in place today were all immortality projects of men and women who came before us. They are the remnants of conceptual selves that ceased to die. Names like Jesus, Muhammad, Napoleon, and Shakespeare are just as powerful today as when those men lived, if not more so. And that’s the whole point. Whether it be through mastering an art form, conquering a new land, gaining great riches, or simply having a large and loving family that will live on for generations, all the meaning in our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die.

Becker later came to a startling realization on his deathbed: that people’s immortality projects were actually the problem, not the solution; that rather than attempting to implement, often through lethal force, their conceptual self across the world, people should question their conceptual self and become more comfortable with the reality of their own death. Becker called this “the bitter antidote,” and struggled with reconciling it himself as he stared down his own demise. While death is bad, it is inevitable.

Confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it obliterates all the crappy, fragile, superficial values in life. While most people whittle their days chasing another buck, or a little bit more fame and attention, or a little bit more assurance that they’re right or loved, death confronts all of us with a far more painful and important question: What is your legacy?

As Becker pointed out, this is arguably the only truly important question in our life. Yet we avoid thinking about it. One, because it’s hard. Two, because it’s scary. Three, because we have no fucking clue what we’re doing. And when we avoid this question, we let trivial and hateful values hijack our brains and take control of our desires and ambitions. Without acknowledging the ever-present gaze of death, the superficial will appear important, and the important will appear superficial. Death is the only thing we can know with any certainty. And as such, it must be the compass by which we orient all of our other values and decisions. It is the correct answer to all of the questions we should ask but never do.

Whether you’re listening to Aristotle or the psychologists at Harvard or Jesus Christ or the goddamn Beatles, they all say that happiness comes from the same thing: caring about something greater than yourself, believing that you are a contributing component in some much larger entity, that your life is but a mere side process of some great unintelligible production. This feeling is what people go to church for; it’s what they fight in wars for; it’s what they raise families and save pensions and build bridges and invent cell phones for: this fleeting sense of being part of something greater and more unknowable than themselves. And entitlement strips this away from us.

Bukowski once wrote, “We’re all going to die, all of us. What a circus! That alone should make us love each other, but it doesn’t. We are terrorized and flattened by life’s trivialities; we are eaten up by nothing.” Looking back on that night, out by that lake, when I watched my friend Josh’s body getting fished out of the lake by paramedics. I remember staring into the black Texas night and watching my ego slowly dissolve into it. Josh’s death taught me much more than I initially realized. Yes, it helped me to seize the day, to take responsibility for my choices, and to pursue my dreams with less shame and inhibition. But these were side effects of a deeper, more primary lesson. And the primary lesson was this: there is nothing to be afraid of. Ever. And reminding myself of my own death repeatedly over the years—whether it be through meditation, through reading philosophy, or through doing crazy shit like standing on a cliff in South Africa—is the only thing that has helped me hold this realization front and center in my mind. This acceptance of my death, this understanding of my own fragility, has made everything easier—untangling my addictions, identifying and confronting my own entitlement, accepting responsibility for my own problems—suffering through my fears and uncertainties, accepting my failures and embracing rejections—it has all been made lighter by the thought of my own death. The more I peer into the darkness, the brighter life gets, the quieter the world becomes, and the less unconscious resistance I feel to, well, anything.

If pursuing the positive is a negative, then pursuing the negative generates the positive. The pain you pursue in the gym results in better all-around health and energy. The failures in business are what lead to a better understanding of what’s necessary to be successful. Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance. Seriously, I could keep going, but you get the point. Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience.

The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they’re exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they’re obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all. It’s anti-entitlement. People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great—they are mediocre, they are average—and that they could be so much better.

As a precursor to brainstorming (or any other approach to finding threats), reviewing threats to systems similar to yours is a helpful starting point in threat modeling. You can do this using search engines, or by checking the academic literature and following citations. It can be incredibly helpful to search on competitors or related products. To start, search on a competitor, appending terms such as “security,” “security bug,” “penetration test,” “pwning,” or “Black Hat,” and use your creativity.

There's no direct line from assets to threats, and no prescriptive set of steps. Essentially, effort put into enumerating assets is effort you're not spending finding or fixing threats. Sometimes, that involves a discussion of what's an asset, or which type of asset you're discussing. That discussion, at best, results in a list of things to look for in your software or operational model, so why not start by creating such a model?

If you find a trust boundary crossing an element of a diagram other than a data flow, either break that element into two (in the model, in reality, or both), or draw a subdiagram to show them separated into multiple entities.

The trust boundaries delineate the attack surface between principals. This leads some to expect that threats appear only between the principals on the boundary, or only matter on the trust boundaries. That expectation is sometimes incorrect.

Data flows should almost never be labeled using verbs. Even though it can be hard, you should work to find more descriptive labels than “read” or “write,” which are implied by the direction of the arrows. In other words, data flows communicate their information (nouns) to processes, which are active: verbs, verb phrases, or verb/noun chains.

Don't have data sinks: You write the data for a reason. Show who uses it. Data can't move itself from one data store to another: Show the process that moves it. All ways data can arrive should be shown. If there are mechanisms for controlling data flows (such as firewalls or permissions) they should be shown. All processes must have at least one entry data flow and one exit data flow.

Adding boundaries to show who controls what is a simple way to improve the diagram. You can pretty easily see that the threats that cross those boundaries are likely important ones, and may be a good place to start identifying threats. These boundaries are called trust boundaries, and you should draw them wherever different people control different things. Good examples of this include the following: Accounts (UIDs on unix systems, or SIDS on Windows) Network interfaces Different physical computers Virtual machines Organizational boundaries Almost anywhere you can argue for different privileges

A system that exposes lots of interfaces presents a larger attack surface than one that presents few APIs or other interfaces. Network firewalls are useful boundaries because they reduce the attack surface relative to an external attacker. However, much like the Captain's safe, there are still trust boundaries inside the firewall. A trust boundary and an attack surface are very similar views of the same thing. An attack surface is a trust boundary and a direction from which an attacker could launch an attack.

Documents that you want users of your network to have access to, such as the policies and procedures they should follow to get service. Internal IT repository. The info you need internally to help you do your job, such as contact info for vendors, written instructions for tasks, and so on.

I document all the tasks that I hate to do, which I would give to an assistant if I had one. The next time there is a hiring opportunity, I can refer to the repository for a list of what to include in the job description for my new assistant: create accounts, change backup tapes, fix common printer problems, and so on. Gosh, isn’t it an amazing coincidence that those things are already well-documented and ready for someone else to take over?

Adam Moskowitz, a well-known SA, tells me that his litmus test for whether something is “automated enough” is that he can delegate the task to someone less skilled. For example, once, he automated his company’s disk backups to the point that the company secretary was able to take over the daily tape-changing tasks.

one of the benefits of documenting a procedure is that writing down the steps is the key to being able to automate something. I wasn’t kidding. In fact, when I don’t have time to automate something, I write the step-by-step procedure on my Wiki telling someone else how to do the task. When I do that, I’ve accomplished two things.

Don’t try to turn one OS into another. Aliases are great, but don’t overdo it. I’ve often seen people developing dozens of aliases so that they can type DOS commands in Unix. I think this is a bad idea. You’re never going to learn Unix that way, and the next time you are on someone else’s machine and don’t have access to those aliases, you’ll be stuck.

after editing /etc/aliases (part of sendmail, Postfix, and various mail-transport-agent packages), you must run the newaliases command. That’s pretty easy to remember, right? After editing Postfix’s transports file, should you run the newtransports command? No, that would be too obvious. You must run postmap transports. And there is the m4 command to run after editing .m4 files, and so on and so on. Who has time to remember which command is used after which file is edited? Details like that are what computers are for. make to the rescue! You might think of make as a programming tool — the program you run when compiling software. In reality, it lets you set up any kind of relationship involving the need to run a command to update one file if another changes.

The routine was simple: after an hour, a particular manager (the boss of the chief system administrator) would be notified of an outage, even if it was late at night. The system administrators would then update this person every half hour until the problem was resolved. The manager would notify upper management and customers (if the outage didn’t prevent communication to the customers) so the SAs could focus on solving the problem.

The Cycle goes like this: each day starts by investing 10 minutes to plan my day. The planning process is simple: Create today’s schedule. On today’s schedule I block out time for all my meetings and appointments. All these events should already be listed on my calendar (I cover how this happens in Chapter 6). I count how many hours are remaining. Those are my work hours for the day. Create today’s to do list . On today’s to do list, I have a list of all the to do items I have on my plate for that day. These to do items are culled from phone calls, meetings, my calendar, our request-tracking system, and the previous day’s to do list. Prioritize and reschedule. For each item, I estimate how much time the item will take to accomplish. I total the time estimates. If the total time is more than my total work hours, I move individual items to the next day’s list. We’ll talk about techniques for selecting what to move later. Work the plan. I spend the day working on the tasks in my list and attending meetings/appointments. I stay focused. When something is complete, I mark it with an X. Finish the day. At the end of the day, I move all the unfinished tasks to the next day’s list. I mark the items that were moved with a hyphen. Leave the office. Now I can leave the office. I am happy with the knowledge that every item on my list was managed — it was either done or moved to the next day. Nothing was forgotten. Repeat. The next day The Cycle starts over again. Each day’s to do list comes prepopulated with items moved from previous days.

In this case, I happened to genuinely believe that the Starrett bid wasn’t legitimate, that the company would never close the deal and would not be able to successfully develop the site even if the deal did go through. The fact is that anyone can bid anything, particularly when there are all sorts of contingencies.

Ironically, the whole controversy may have ended up being a plus for me in terms of selling Trump Tower. The stories that appeared about it invariably started with sentences like: “In order to make way for one of the world’s most luxurious buildings …” Even though the publicity was almost entirely negative, there was a great deal of it, and that drew a tremendous amount of attention to Trump Tower. Almost immediately we saw an upsurge in the sales of apartments. I’m not saying that’s a good thing, and in truth it probably says something perverse about the culture we live in. But I’m a businessman, and I learned a lesson from that experience: good publicity is preferable to bad, but from a bottom-line perspective, bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all. Controversy, in short, sells.

In every previous situation, companies who purchased or assembled sites in Atlantic City had begun the licensing process and construction concurrently. Licensing could take as long as construction, and the sooner the casino got built, the faster it could start earning money. It’s perfectly logical—so long as your licensing comes through in the end. But unlike these other companies, I didn’t want to put several hundred million dollars at risk in the meantime. Also, I didn’t want to be in a weak negotiating position with the Casino Control Commission. Once you’ve begun investing huge sums of money, it’s very hard to say no to anything they ask for.

It was the latter that worried me, since we had yet to do much work on the site. One week before the board meeting, I got an idea. I called in my construction supervisor and told him that I wanted him to round up every bulldozer and dump truck he could possibly find, and put them to work on my site immediately. Over the next week, I said, I wanted him to transform my two acres of nearly vacant property into the most active construction site in the history of the world. What the bulldozers and dump trucks did wasn’t important, I said, so long as they did a lot of it. If they got some actual work accomplished, all the better, but if necessary, he should have the bulldozers dig up dirt from one side of the site and dump it on the other.

It was located on East 54th Street, and its membership included some of the most successful men and the most beautiful women in the world. It was the sort of place where you were likely to see a wealthy seventy-five-year-old guy walk in with three blondes from Sweden. I’ll never forget how I became a member. One day I called up Le Club and I said, “My name is Donald Trump and I’d like to join your club.” The guy on the other end of the phone just laughed and said, “You’ve got to be kidding.” Nobody, of course, had heard of me. The next day I got another idea, and I called back and I said to the guy, “Listen, could I have a list of your members?

I said, very politely, “My name is Donald Trump, and I’d like to join Le Club.” And he said, “Do you have any friends or family in the club?” and I said, “No, I don’t know anybody there.” He said, “Well, what makes you think you should be admitted as a member?” I just kept talking and talking, and finally this fellow said to me, “I’ll tell you what, you sound like a nice young man, and maybe it would be good to have some younger members, so why don’t you meet me for a drink at Twenty-one?”

“There is no need to treat a Lonely Planet book like a bible,” travel publisher Tony Wheeler once told me in an interview. “Just because we don’t list certain restaurants and hotels doesn’t mean they aren’t any good. Sometimes people even write to say they use our books only to see where not to go. They don’t want to stay with everybody else, so they go to the hotels that aren’t listed in the Lonely Planet. I think that’s great because we encourage travelers to be different.”

A great alternative to using a guidebook—especially once you’ve gotten the hang of vagabonding—is to rely instead on an accurate regional map and a language phrase book. You might miss out on a little contextual information this way, but the quirky destinations and human-centered adventures you’ll find in this process will more than make up for it.

“We see as we are,” said the Buddha, and rarely is this quite so evident as when we travel. Unlike a simple vacation (where you rarely have time to interact with your environment), vagabonding revolves around the people you meet on the road—and the attitude you take into these encounters can make or break your entire travel experience. “If you view the world as a predominately hostile place, it will be,” wrote Ed Buryn. By this same logic, of course, a positive worldview can lead to inspiring, human-centered road experiences.

The similarities between a psychological crowd and a losing market participant are striking. Remember, it is not a function of a quantity of individuals that determines if a psychological crowd has formed. Rather, it is a function of the characteristics displayed. If a person is exhibiting these characteristics, then he is part of a psychological crowd and is making crowd trades.

The first thing you decide is what type of participant you are going to be (investor or speculator). Then you select what market you are going to participate in (stocks, bonds, currencies, futures). The plan you develop must be consistent with the characteristics and time horizon of the type of participant you choose to be. Why? Changing your initial time horizon in the middle of a trade changes the type of participant you are and is almost as dangerous as betting or gambling in the market.

Almost all commentary on the development of a plan will list the ingredients as entry, stop-loss, and price objective. However, to be effective as a loss-control tool, the plan must be derived by deciding STOP, ENTRY, then PRICE OBJECTIVE. Failure to choose a price objective could cost the trader some potential profits. A poor entry price could increase losses or reduce profits. But not having a predetermined stop-loss can, and ultimately will, cost you a lot of money.

You can be rewarded for doing the “wrong thing,” and you can be rewarded for doing the “right thing” for the wrong reason. I did that a lot during the early part of my life. However, if you continue to do the wrong thing in the market and get rewarded, your profits won’t be linked to any particular recurring set of circumstances or rule following on your part.

Because people tend to regard loss, wrong, bad, and failure as the same thing, it is little wonder that loss is a dirty word in our vocabulary. However, in the markets losses should be viewed like the light bulbs or rotten fruit mentioned earlier: part of the business and taken with equanimity. Loss is not the same as wrong, and loss is not necessarily bad. For example, consider exiting a losing position with a small loss but before the loss got bigger. That was a loss, but it was a good decision.

For terminally ill patients, the one thing that usually persists through all these stages is hope. Even the most accepting patients left open the possibility for some cure, the discovery of a new drug or last-minute success in a research project. They showed the greatest confidence in the doctors who allowed for such hope and appreciated it when hope was offered in spite of bad news. This is the same hope I was relying on when the bean-oil position was deteriorating.

The market participant doesn’t have to move directly to the acceptance stage. He can loop back to denial after each and every temporary reprieve the market gives him. If the market rallies some, he thinks the market has finally turned. But when the market starts back down again, he slips back into denial, then anger, and so on.

Even if the position is a net profit, the trader or investor can go through the Five Stages. Consider when a market position is profitable but not as profitable as it once was. When that happens, he becomes married to the price at which it was the most profitable. He denies that the move is over, gets angry when the market starts to sell off, makes a bargain that he’ll get out if the market moves back to that arbitrary point, gets depressed that he didn’t get out, and maybe even lets the profit turn into a loss, thus slipping again into denial, then anger, etc.

The professional gambler is similar to the stock arbitrageur in that they both take calculated risks. They are dealing with an uncertain outcome and seek to profit from their ability to anticipate the future or to see the future—in other words, to speculate. Professional gamblers are actually speculators because of the characteristics they exhibit when risking money. They are not seeking entertainment at the tables like gamblers do, and they are not trying to be right. They are trying to make money.

The definition of risk is to expose to the chance or possibility of loss. Most people erroneously try to assign a numerical value to that chance, which simply confuses risk with probability. In the markets we are talking about unique, nonrepeatable events, so we can’t assign a frequency probability to their occurrence.

Perhaps the most common fallacy to which market participants are susceptible is money odds vs. probability odds. Many market participants express the probability of success in terms of a risk-reward ratio. For example, if I bought my famous takeover stock (which you will hear about in the next chapter) at twenty-six dollars and placed a sell stop below the market at twenty-three dollars with an upside objective of thirty-six dollars, my risk-reward ratio would be three to ten. Risk three dollars to make ten dollars. It is clear that I don’t understand probability. Couching my rationalizations in arithmetic terms does not automatically lend credibility to my position. The three-to-ten ratio has nothing to do with the probability that the stock can or will get to thirty-six dollars. All the ratio does is compare the dollar amount of what I think I might lose to the dollar amount of what I think I might make. But it doesn’t say anything about the probability of either event occurring

You might have to pay for a mentor, and most people who can help you value their time at a high level. If you think mentorship is expensive, try mediocrity.

Growth friends are the people you want to spend MORE time with because you are growing together, challenging each other, holding each other to higher standards, and making each other better.
