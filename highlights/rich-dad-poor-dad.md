#  Rich Dad Poor Dad
## by Robert Kiyosaki

 - loc 132 - For example, one dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford it.” The other dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I ask, “How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think.

 - loc 164 - He would say things like, “I’m a rich man, and rich people don’t do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a major financial setback, he continued to refer to himself as a rich man.

 - loc 178 - “I don’t work for money!” were words he would repeat over and over. “Money works for me!”

 - loc 203 - Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth.

 - loc 498 - “You’re taxed when you earn. You’re taxed when you spend. You’re taxed when you save. You’re taxed when you die.”

 - loc 613 - “So is a poor man happier?” I asked. “No, I don’t think so,” replied rich dad. “The avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being attached to money.”

 - loc 655 - If you don’t first handle fear and desire, and you get rich, you’ll only be a highly paid slave.”

 - loc 737 - the rich know that money is an illusion, truly like the carrot for the donkey. It’s only out of fear and greed that the illusion of money is held together by billions of people who believe that money is real. It’s not.

 - loc 797 - In 1923 a group of our greatest leaders and richest businessmen held a meeting at the Edgewater Beach hotel in Chicago. Among them were Charles Schwab, head of the largest independent steel company; Samuel Insull, president of the world’s largest utility; Howard Hopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar Kreuger, president of International Match Co., one of the world’s largest companies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of International Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange; Arthur Cotton and Jesse Livermore, two of the biggest stock speculators; and Albert Fall, a member of President Harding’s cabinet. Twenty-five years later, nine of these titans ended their lives as follows: Schwab died penniless after living for five years on borrowed money. Insull died broke in a foreign land, and Kreuger and Cotton also died broke. Hopson went insane. Whitney and Albert Fall were released from prison, and Fraser and Livermore committed suicide.

 - loc 841 - Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets. Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets.

 - loc 841 - Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets. Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. If you want to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is rule number one. It is the only rule.

 - loc 868 - An asset puts money in my pocket. A liability takes money out of my pocket.

 - loc 893 - Numbers alone mean little, just as words out of context mean little. It’s the story that counts. In financial reporting, reading numbers is looking for the plot, the story of where the cash is flowing

 - loc 911 - Money only accentuates the cash-flow pattern running in your head. If your pattern is to spend everything you get, most likely an increase in cash will just result in an increase in spending. Thus, the saying, “A fool and his money is one big party.”

 - loc 958 - As a child, my dad often told us that the Japanese were aware of three powers: the power of the sword, the jewel, and the mirror. The sword symbolizes the power of weapons. America has spent trillions of dollars on weapons and, because of this, is a powerful military presence in the world. The jewel symbolizes the power of money. There is some degree of truth to the saying, “Remember the golden rule. He who has the gold makes the rules.” The mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge. This self-knowledge, according to Japanese legend, was the most treasured of the three.

 - loc 970 - It is said that the fear of public speaking is a fear greater than death for most people. According to psychiatrists, the fear of public speaking is caused by the fear of ostracism, the fear of standing out, the fear of criticism, the fear of ridicule, and the fear of being an outcast. The fear of being different prevents most people from seeking new ways to solve their problems.

 - loc 986 - Here was a man who had left school at 13 who was now directing, instructing, ordering, and asking questions of educated people. They came at his beck and call, and cringed when he didn’t approve of them. Here was a man who had not gone along with the crowd.

 - loc 992 - “An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than he is.”

 - loc 1015 - high emotions tend to lower financial intelligence. I know from personal experience that money has a way of making every decision emotional.

 - loc 1023 - •My wife’s parents were shocked when the property taxes on their home increased to $1,000 a month. This was after they had retired, so the increase put a strain on their retirement budget, and they felt forced to move.

 - loc 1032 - In summary, the end result in making a decision to own a house that is too expensive in lieu of starting an investment portfolio impacts an individual in at least the following three ways: 1.Loss of time, during which other assets could have grown in value. 2.Loss of additional capital, which could have been invested instead of paying for high-maintenance expenses related directly to the home. 3.Loss of education. Too often, people count their house and savings and retirement plans as all they have in their asset column. Because they have no money to invest, they simply don’t invest. This costs them investment experience. Most never become what the investment world calls “a sophisticated investor.” And the best investments are usually first sold to sophisticated investors, who then turn around and sell them to the people playing it safe.

 - loc 1043 - When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house.

 - loc 1104 - Wealth is a person’s ability to survive so many number of days forward—or, if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?

 - loc 1163 - If you study the law, you become an attorney, and a study of auto mechanics makes you a mechanic. The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many people forget to mind their own business. They spend their lives minding someone else’s business and making that person rich.

 - loc 1187 - I cringe every time I hear someone say to me that their net worth is a million dollars or $100,000 dollars or whatever. One of the main reasons net worth is not accurate is simply because, the moment you begin selling your assets, you are taxed for any gains.

 - loc 1238 - When I say mind your own business, I mean to build and keep your asset column strong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come out. Think of it this way: Once a dollar goes into your asset column, it becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 24 hours a day and can work for generations.

 - loc 1241 - An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first.

 - loc 1319 - A corporation is merely a legal document that creates a legal body without a soul.

 - loc 1355 - That is why he paid so much for smart tax accountants and attorneys. It was less expensive to pay them than to pay the government.

 - loc 1432 - Garret Sutton’s books on corporations provide wonderful insight into the power of personal corporations.

 - loc 1454 - We all have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed with gifts. Yet the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self-doubt.

 - loc 1551 - If your hunch is wrong, and what you’ve been counting on doesn’t happen, how can you turn a lemon into millions? That is financial intelligence. It is not so much what happens, but how many different financial solutions you can think of to turn a lemon into millions. It is how creative you are in solving financial problems.

 - loc 1621 - And the escrow company handles the legal transaction and the servicing of the payments. I have no roofs to fix or toilets to unplug because the owners do that. It’s their house. Occasionally someone does not pay. And that is wonderful because there are late fees, or they move out and the property is sold again. The court system handles that.

 - loc 1642 - Financial intelligence is made up of these four main technical skills: 1.Accounting Accounting is financial literacy, or the ability to read numbers. This is a vital skill if you want to build businesses or investments. 2.Investing Investing is the science of money making money. 3.Understanding markets Understanding markets is the science of supply and demand Alexander Graham Bell gave the market what it wanted. So did Bill Gates. A $75,000 house offered for $60,000 that cost $20,000 was also the result of seizing an opportunity created by the market. Somebody was buying, and someone was selling. 4.The law The law is the awareness of accounting corporate, state and federal regulations. I recommend playing by the rules.

 - loc 1710 - The problem with “secure” investments is that they are often sanitized, that is, made so safe that the gains are less.

 - loc 1759 - Great opportunities are not seen with your eyes. They are seen with your mind. Most people never get wealthy simply because they are not trained financially to recognize opportunities right in front of them.

 - loc 1796 - I learned how to buy houses without a bank. It was the learned skill of raising money, more than the houses themselves, that was priceless.

 - loc 1801 - There have been many times I have bought a house, a stock, or an apartment building without a penny in the bank. I once bought an apartment house for $1.2 million. I did what is called “tying it up,” with a written contract between seller and buyer. I then raised the $100,000 deposit, which bought me 90 days to raise the rest of the money. Why did I do it? Simply because I knew it was worth $2 million. I never raised the money. Instead, the person who put up the $100,000 gave me $50,000 for finding the deal, took over my position, and I walked away. Total working time: three days. Again, it’s what you know more than what you buy. Investing is not buying. It’s more a case of knowing.

 - loc 1900 - I resigned my commission, even though I loved flying. I found a job with Xerox Corp. I joined it for one reason, and it was not for the benefits. I was a shy person, and the thought of selling was the most frightening subject in the world. Xerox has one of the best sales-training programs in America.

 - loc 1958 - Life is much like going to the gym. The most painful part is deciding to go. Once you get past that, it’s easy. There have been many days I have dreaded going to the gym, but once I am there and in motion, it is a pleasure.

 - loc 1958 - Life is much like going to the gym. The most painful part is deciding to go. Once you get past that, it’s easy. There have been many days I have dreaded going to the gym, but once I am there and in motion, it is a pleasure. After the workout is over, I am always glad I talked myself into going.

 - loc 1977 - McDonald’s is excellent at business systems. The reason so many talented people are poor is because they focus on building a better hamburger and know little to nothing about business systems.

 - loc 2099 - “Texans don’t bury their failures. They get inspired by them. They take their failures and turn them into rallying cries. Failure inspires Texans to become winners. But that formula is not just the formula for Texans. It is the formula for all winners.”

 - loc 2160 - It often takes great courage to not let rumors and talk of doom and gloom affect your doubts and fears. But a savvy investor knows that the seemingly worst of times is actually the best of times to make money.

 - loc 2173 - Richard’s backing out did not surprise me. It’s called buyer’s remorse, and it affects all of us. The little chicken won, and a chance at freedom was lost.

 - loc 2196 - A great property manager is key to success in real estate. Finding a good manager is more important to me than the real estate. A great property manager often hears of great deals before real estate agents do, which makes them even more valuable.

 - loc 2232 - That’s the most common form of laziness: laziness by staying busy.

 - loc 2321 - “What I know makes me money. What I don’t know loses me money. Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money. Because when I’m arrogant, I truly believe that what I don’t know is not important,” rich dad would often tell me.

 - loc 2397 - I was listening to an investor say something I completely disagreed with. Instead of becoming arrogant and critical, I simply listened to that five-minute stretch at least 20 times, maybe more. But suddenly, by keeping my mind open, I understood why he said what he said. It was like magic. I felt like I had a window into the mind of one of the greatest investors of our time. I gained tremendous insight into the vast resources of his education and experience.

 - loc 2459 - For three years, while working for Xerox, I spent my spare time learning to master the art of buying foreclosures. I’ve made several million dollars using that formula. So after I mastered that formula, I went in search of other formulas.

 - loc 2467 - In today’s fast-changing world, it’s not so much what you know anymore that counts, because often what you know is old. It is how fast you learn.

 - loc 2507 - There have been times in my life when, for whatever reason, cash flow was far less than my bills. I still paid myself first. My accountant and bookkeeper screamed in panic,

 - loc 2522 - When I occasionally come up short, I still pay myself first. I let the creditors and even the government scream. I like it when they get tough. Why? Because those guys do me a favor. They inspire me to go out and create more money. So I pay myself first, invest the money, and let the creditors yell. I generally pay them right away anyway. Kim and I have excellent credit. We just don’t cave in to pressure and spend our savings or liquidate stocks to pay for consumer debt. That is not too financially intelligent.

 - loc 2535 - The rich know that savings are only used to create more money, not to pay bills.

 - loc 2549 - What I pay a broker is tiny in comparison with what kind of money I can make because of the information they provide. I love it when my real estate broker or stockbroker makes a lot of money because that usually means I made a lot of money.

 - loc 2552 - A broker is my eyes and ears in the market. They’re there every day so I do not have to be. I’d rather play golf.

 - loc 2552 - A broker is my eyes and ears in the market. They’re there every day so I do not have to be. I’d rather play golf. People who sell their house on their own must not value their time much.

 - loc 2655 - I also have heroes such as Donald Trump, Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, George Soros, and Jim Rogers. I know their stats just like I knew the ERAs and RBIs of my childhood baseball heroes.

 - loc 2658 - when I’m in the market or I’m negotiating a deal, I am subconsciously acting with the bravado of Trump. Or when analyzing a trend, I look at it as though Warren Buffet were doing it. By having heroes, we tap into a tremendous source of raw genius.

 - loc 2669 - Whenever you feel short or in need of something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets. That is true for money, a smile, love, or friendship.

 - loc 2677 - It reminds me of the story of the guy sitting with firewood in his arms on a cold, freezing night. He is yelling at the pot-bellied stove, “When you give me some heat, then I’ll put some wood in you!” And when it comes to money, love, happiness, sales, and contacts, all one needs to remember is to give first.

 - loc 2729 - I always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an offer with language that details “subject-to” contingencies, such as the approval of a business partner. Never specify who the business partner is. Most people don’t know that my partner is my cat.

 - loc 2729 - I always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an offer with language that details “subject-to” contingencies, such as the approval of a business partner. Never specify who the business partner is. Most people don’t know that my partner is my cat. If they accept the offer, and I don’t want the deal, I call home and speak to my cat. I make this ridiculous statement to illustrate how absurdly easy and simple the game is.

 - loc 2826 - Passive income, in most cases, is income derived from real estate investments. Portfolio income is income derived from paper assets such as stocks and bonds.

 - loc 2839 - The key to financial freedom and great wealth is a person’s ability to convert earned income into passive and/or portfolio income.
