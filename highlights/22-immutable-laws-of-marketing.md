#  22 Immutable Laws of Marketing
## by Al Ries & Jack Trout
---

 - loc 82 - Law 1: The Law of Leadership. It’s better to be first than it is to be better.

 - loc 135 - “FedEx this package to the Coast.” If you’re introducing the first brand in a new category, you should always try to select a name that can work generically. (Lawyers advise the opposite, but what do they know about the laws of marketing?)

 - loc 162 - Law 2: The Law of the Category. If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in.

 - loc 181 - The most successful computer company of the seventies and eighties, next to IBM, was Digital Equipment Corporation. IBM was first in computers. DEC was first in minicomputers.

 - loc 189 - Commodore was just another manufacturer of home personal computers that wasn’t going anywhere until it positioned the Amiga as the first multimedia computer.

 - loc 193 - When you launch a new product, the first question to ask yourself is not “How is this new product better than the competition?” but “First what?” In other words, what category is this new product first in?

 - loc 205 - Law 3: The Law of the Mind. It’s better to be first in the mind than it is to be first in the marketplace

 - loc 211 - Du Mont invented the first commercial television set. Duryea introduced the first automobile. Hurley introduced the first washing machine. All are gone. Is something wrong with the law of leadership in chapter 1? No, but the law of the mind modifies it. It’s better to be first in the prospect’s mind than first in the marketplace. Which, if anything, understates the importance of being first in the mind. Being first in the mind is everything in marketing. Being first in the marketplace is important only to the extent that it allows you to get in the mind first. For example, IBM wasn’t first in the marketplace with the mainframe computer. Remington Rand was first, with UNIVAC. But thanks to a massive marketing effort, IBM got into the mind first and won the computer battle early. The law of the mind follows from the law of perception. If marketing is a battle of perception, not product, then the mind takes precedence over the marketplace.

 - loc 229 - Xerox was first in copiers and then tried to get into the computer business. Twenty-five years and $2 billion later, Xerox is nowhere in computers.

 - loc 232 - The single most wasteful thing you can do in marketing is try to change a mind.

 - loc 245 - Law 4: The Law of Perception. Marketing is not a battle of products, it’s a battle of perception.

 - loc 252 - There is no objective reality. There are no facts. There are no best products. All that exists in the world of marketing are perceptions in the minds of the customer or prospect. The perception is the reality. Everything else is an illusion.

 - loc 256 - Most people think they are better perceivers than others. They have a sense of personal infallibility. Their perceptions are always more accurate than those of their neighbors or friends. Truth and perception become fused in the mind, leaving no difference between the two. It’s not easy to see that this is so. To cope with the terrifying reality of being alone in the universe, people project themselves on the outside world. They “live” in the arena of books, movies, television, newspapers, magazines. They “belong” to clubs, organizations, institutions. These outside representations of the world seem more real than the reality inside their own minds. People cling firmly to the belief that reality is the world outside of the mind and that the individual is one small speck on a global spaceship. Actually it’s the opposite. The only reality you can be sure about is in your own perceptions. If the universe exists, it exists inside your own mind and the minds of others. That’s the reality that marketing programs must deal with.

 - loc 266 - Most marketing mistakes stem from the assumption that you’re fighting a product battle rooted in reality.

 - loc 307 - What makes the battle even more difficult is that customers frequently make buying decisions based on second-hand perceptions. Instead of using their own perceptions, they base their buying decisions on someone else’s perception of reality. This is the “everybody knows” principle. Everybody knows that the Japanese make higher-quality cars than the Americans do. So people make buying decisions based on the fact that everybody knows the Japanese make higher-quality cars. When you ask shoppers whether they have had any personal experience with a product, most often they say they haven’t. And, more often than not, their own experience is often twisted to conform to their perceptions.

 - loc 325 - Law 5: The Law of Focus. The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect’s mind.

 - loc 333 - In a way, the law of leadership—it’s better to be first than to be better—enables the first brand or company to own a word in the mind of the prospect. But the word the leader owns is so simple that it’s invisible. The leader owns the word that stands for the category.

 - loc 337 - You can also test the validity of a leadership claim by a word association test. If the given words are computer, copier, chocolate bar, and cola, the four most associated words are IBM, Xerox, Hershey’s, and Coke. An astute leader will go one step further to solidify its position. Heinz owns the word ketchup. But Heinz went on to isolate the most important ketchup attribute. “Slowest ketchup in the West” is how the company is preempting the thickness attribute. Owning the word slow helps Heinz maintain a 50 percent market share. If you’re not a leader, then your word has to have a narrow focus. Even more important, however, your word has to be “available” in your category. No one else can have a lock on it.

 - loc 342 - If you’re not a leader, then your word has to have a narrow focus. Even more important, however, your word has to be “available” in your category. No one else can have a lock on it.

 - loc 345 - The most effective words are simple and benefit oriented.

 - loc 347 - there’s the halo effect. If you strongly establish one benefit, the prospect is likely to give you a lot of other benefits, too.

 - loc 372 - Many companies see the advantage of owning a single word or concept (often called “the corporate vision”), but they neglect to be the first to preempt the word.

 - loc 381 - The essence of marketing is narrowing the focus. You become stronger when you reduce the scope of your operations

 - loc 391 - Does any company proclaim itself as the “unquality” corporation? No, everybody stands for quality. As a result, nobody does.

 - loc 416 - Law 6: The Law of Exclusivity. Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect’s mind.

 - loc 420 - Volvo owns safety. Many other automobile companies, including Mercedes-Benz and General Motors, have tried to run marketing campaigns based on safety. Yet no one except Volvo has succeeded in getting into the prospect’s mind with a safety message.

 - loc 437 - What often leads marketers down this booby-trapped lane is that wonderful stuff called research.

 - loc 441 - long-lasting is what people want, that’s what we should advertise. Right? Wrong. What researchers never tell you is that some other company already owns the idea.

 - loc 441 - If long-lasting is what people want, that’s what we should advertise. Right? Wrong. What researchers never tell you is that some other company already owns the idea.

 - loc 445 - A market study showed that the most popular attribute for fast food was “fast” (no big surprise there). So Burger King did what most red-blooded marketers do. It turned to its advertising agency and said, “If the world wants fast, our advertising should tell them we’re fast.” What was overlooked in the research was that McDonald’s was already perceived as being the fastest hamburger chain in the country. Fast belonged to McDonald’s. Undaunted by this, Burger King launched its campaign with the slogan “Best food for fast times.” The program quickly became a disaster

 - loc 445 - market study showed that the most popular attribute for fast food was “fast” (no big surprise there). So Burger King did what most red-blooded marketers do. It turned to its advertising agency and said, “If the world wants fast, our advertising should tell them we’re fast.” What was overlooked in the research was that McDonald’s was already perceived as being the fastest hamburger chain in the country. Fast belonged to McDonald’s. Undaunted by this, Burger King launched its campaign with the slogan “Best food for fast times.” The program quickly became a disaster very nearly on a par with the one that involved “Herb.”

 - loc 453 - Law 7: The Law of the Ladder. The strategy to use depends on which rung you occupy on the ladder.

 - loc 459 - For each category, there is a product ladder in the mind. On each rung is a brand name. Take the car rental category. Hertz got into the mind first and wound up on the top rung. Avis got in second and National got in third.

 - loc 464 - The reader looked at the ad and wondered, How could they have the finest rent-a-car service when they’re not on the top rung of my ladder? Then Avis did the one thing you have to do to make progress inside the mind of the prospect. They acknowledged their position on the ladder. “Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars. So why go with us? We try harder.” For 13 years in a row, Avis had lost money. Then, when it admitted to being No. 2, it started to make money, lots of money.

 - loc 471 - Many marketing people have misread the Avis story. They assume the company was successful because it tried harder (i.e., it had the better service). But that wasn’t it at all. Avis was successful because it related itself to the position of Hertz in the mind.

 - loc 483 - How many rungs are there on your ladder? It depends on whether your product is a high-interest or a low-interest product. Products you use every day (cigarettes, cola, beer, toothpaste, cereal) tend to be high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders. Products that are purchased infrequently (furniture, lawn mowers, luggage) usually have few rungs on their ladders. Products that involve a great deal of personal pride (automobiles, watches, cameras) are also high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders even though they are purchased infrequently.

 - loc 491 - There’s a relationship between market share and your position on the ladder in the prospect’s mind. You tend to have twice the market share of the brand below you and half the market share of the brand above you.

 - loc 500 - What’s the maximum number of rungs on a ladder? There seems to be a rule of seven in the prospect’s mind. Ask someone to name all the brands he or she remembers in a given category. Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category. According to Harvard psychologist Dr. George A. Miller, the average human mind cannot deal with more than seven units at a time.

 - loc 518 - Law 8: The Law of Duality. In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race.

 - loc 521 - Early on, a new category is a ladder of many rungs. Gradually, the ladder becomes a two-rung affair.

 - loc 542 - In a maturing industry, third place is a difficult position to be in.

 - loc 544 - Take video games. In the late eighties, the market was dominated by Nintendo with a 75 percent share. The two also-rans were Sega and NEC. Today Nintendo and Sega are neck and neck, and NEC is way behind. In the long run, marketing is a two-game race.

 - loc 546 - Time frames, however, can vary. The fast-moving video game market played itself out in two or three seasons. The long-distance telephone market might take two or three decades.

 - loc 561 - Look at the history of the automobile in the United States. In 1904, 195 different cars were assembled by 60 companies. Within the following 10 years, 531 companies were formed and 346 perished. By 1923, only 108 car makers remained. This number dropped to 44 by 1927. Today, Ford and General Motors dominate the domestic industry, with Chrysler’s future in doubt.

 - loc 572 - We repeat: The customer believes that marketing is a battle of products. It’s this kind of thinking that keeps the two brands on top: “They must be the best, they’re the leaders.”

 - loc 576 - Law 9: The Law of the Opposite. If you’re shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader.

 - loc 587 - When you look at customers in a given product category, there seem to be two kinds of people. There are those who want to buy from the leader and there are those who don’t want to buy from the leader. A potential No. 2 has to appeal to the latter group. In other words, by positioning yourself against the leader, you take business away from all the other alternatives to No. 1. If old people drink Coke and young people drink Pepsi, there’s nobody left to drink Royal Crown cola.

 - loc 587 - When you look at customers in a given product category, there seem to be two kinds of people. There are those who want to buy from the leader and there are those who don’t want to buy from the leader. A potential No. 2 has to appeal to the latter group.

 - loc 587 - When you look at customers in a given product category, there seem to be two kinds of people. There are those who want to buy from the leader and there are those who don’t want to buy from the leader. A potential No. 2 has to appeal to the latter group. In other words, by positioning yourself against the leader, you take business away from all the other alternatives to No. 1. If old people drink Coke and young people drink Pepsi, there’s nobody left to drink Royal Crown cola. Yet, too many potential No. 2 brands try to emulate the leader. This usually is an error. You must present yourself as the alternative.

 - loc 637 - Law 10: The Law of Division. Over time, a category will divide and become two or more categories.

 - loc 642 - A category starts off as a single entity. Computers, for example. But over time, the category breaks up into other segments. Mainframes, minicomputers, workstations, personal computers, laptops, notebooks, pen computers.

 - loc 661 - Instead of understanding this concept of division, many corporate leaders hold the naive belief that categories are combining. Synergy and its kissing cousin the corporate alliance are the buzzwords in the boardrooms of America. IBM, according to the New York Times, is poised “to take advantage of the coming convergence of whole industries, including television, music, publishing and computing.” “IBM’s strongest suit,” says the Times, “in the expected convergence of cable and telephone networks with computer and television manufacturers may be technology that it has developed to create extremely high-speed networks.” (See chapter 20: The Law of Hype.) It won’t happen. Categories are dividing, not combining.

 - loc 673 - Companies make a mistake when they try to take a well-known brand name in one category and use the same brand name in another category. A classic example is the fate that befell Volkswagen, the company that introduced the small-car category to America.

 - loc 678 - “Different Volks for different folks,” said the advertising, which featured five different models, including the Beetle, the 412 Sedan, the Dasher, the Thing, and even a station wagon. Needless to say, the only thing that kept selling was the “small” thing, the Beetle.

 - loc 689 - One of Volkswagen’s competitors, Honda, decided to go up-market. Rather than use the Honda name in the luxury-car market, it introduced the Acura. It even took the expensive step of setting up separate Acura dealerships to avoid confusion with Honda. The Acura became the first Japanese luxury car in the United States, where today Honda sells many more Acuras than Volkswagen sells Volkswagens. Honda now has the leading brand in two categories.

 - loc 699 - You can be too early to exploit a new category. Back in the fifties the Nash Rambler was America’s first small car. But American Motors didn’t have either the courage or the money to hang in there long enough for the category to develop. It’s better to be early than late. You can’t get into the prospect’s mind first unless you’re prepared to spend some time waiting for things to develop.

 - loc 704 - Law 11: The Law of Perspective. Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time.

 - loc 710 - Chemically, alcohol is a strong depressant. But in the short term, by depressing a person’s inhibitions, alcohol acts like a stimulant. Many marketing moves exhibit the same phenomenon. The long-term effects are often the exact opposite of the short-term effects.

 - loc 713 - Obviously, in the short term, a sale increases business. But there’s more and more evidence to show that sales decrease business in the long term by educating customers not to buy at “regular” prices.

 - loc 738 - In the short term, line extension invariably increases sales. The beer industry clearly illustrates this effect. In the early seventies, Miller High Life was barreling along with sales increases averaging 27 percent a year. Miller’s success was fueled by “Miller Time,” a blue-collar campaign focused on rewarding yourself at the end of the day with a Miller beer. Then Miller got greedy and in 1974 introduced Miller Lite, a brilliant concept (chapter 2: The Law of the Category) buried under a line extended name. In the short term the two Millers could coexist: the blue-collar beer (High Life) and the yuppie beer (Lite). But in the long term, line extension was bound to undermine one or the other brand. The high-water mark for Miller High Life was 1979, five years after the introduction of Miller Lite. In those five years Miller High Life’s annual sales almost tripled, from 8.6 million to 23.6 million barrels. This was the short-term effect of line extension. The long-term effect was grim. From a high of 23.6 million barrels in 1979, Miller High Life declined 13 years in a row to just 5.8 million barrels in 1991. And the decline is bound to continue.

 - loc 771 - Law 12: The Law of Line Extension. There’s an irresistible pressure to extend the equity of a brand.

 - loc 776 - By far the most violated law in our book is the law of line extension.

 - loc 804 - In a narrow sense, line extension involves taking the brand name of a successful product (e.g., A-1 steak sauce) and putting it on a new product you plan to introduce (e.g., A-1 poultry sauce). It sounds so logical. “We make A-1, a great sauce that gets the dominant share of the steak business. But people are switching from beef to chicken, so let’s introduce a poultry product. And what better name to use than A-1. That way people will know the poultry sauce comes from the makers of that great steak sauce, A-1.” But marketing is a battle of perception, not product. In the mind, A-1 is not the brand name, but the steak sauce itself. “Would you pass me the A-1?” asks the diner. Nobody replies: “A-1 what?” In spite of an $18 million advertising budget, the A-1 poultry launch was a dismal failure.

 - loc 818 - Invariably, the leader in any category is the brand that is not line extended.

 - loc 838 - Why does top management believe that line extension works, in spite of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary? One reason is that while line extension is a loser in the long term, it can be a winner in the short term (chapter 11: The Law of Perspective). Management is also blinded by an intense loyalty to the company or brand.

 - loc 841 - More is less. The more products, the more markets, the more alliances a company makes, the less money it makes. “Full-speed ahead in all directions” seems to be the call from the corporate bridge. When will companies learn that line extension ultimately leads to oblivion? Less is more. If you want to be successful today, you have to narrow the focus in order to build a position in the prospect’s mind. What does IBM stand for? It used to stand for “mainframe computers.” Today it stands for everything, which means it stands for nothing.

 - loc 863 - Law 13: The Law of Sacrifice. You have to give up something in order to get something.

 - loc 868 - There are three things to sacrifice: product line, target market, and constant change.

 - loc 869 - First, the product line. Where is it written that the more you have to sell, the more you sell? The full line is a luxury for a loser. If you want to be successful, you have to reduce your product line, not expand it. Take Emery Air Freight. Emery was in the air freight services business. Anything you wanted to ship you could ship via Emery. Small packages, large packages, overnight service, delayed service. From a marketing point of view, what did Federal Express do? It concentrated on one service: small packages overnight. Today Federal Express is a much bigger company than Emery.

 - loc 893 - The world of business is populated by big, highly diversified generalists and small, narrowly focused specialists. If line extension and diversification were effective marketing strategies, you’d expect to see the generalists riding high. But they’re not. Most of them are in trouble. The generalist is weak. Take Kraft, for example. Everybody thinks Kraft is a strong brand name. In jellies and jams, Kraft has 9 percent of the market. But Smucker’s has 35 percent. Kraft means everything, but with a name like Smucker’s, it has to be jelly or jam because that’s all Smucker’s makes.

 - loc 920 - Let’s discuss the second sacrifice, target market. Where is it written that you have to appeal to everybody? Take the cola field. Coca-Cola got into the prospect’s mind first and built a powerful position. In the late fifties, for example, Coke outsold Pepsi more than five to one. What could Pepsi-Cola do to go against Coke’s powerful position? In the early sixties Pepsi-Cola finally developed a strategy based on the concept of sacrifice. The company sacrificed everything except the teenage market. Then it brilliantly exploited this market by hiring its icons: Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Don Johnson. Within one generation, Pepsi closed the gap.

 - loc 947 - Finally, the third sacrifice: constant change. Where is it written that you have to change your strategy every year at budget review time?

 - loc 959 - Good things come to those who sacrifice.

 - loc 961 - Law 14: The Law of Attributes. For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute.

 - loc 975 - Cavity prevention is the most important attribute in toothpaste. It’s the one to own. But the law of exclusivity points to the simple truth that once an attribute is successfully taken by your competition, it’s gone. You must move on to a lesser attribute and live with a smaller share of the category. Your job is to seize a different attribute, dramatize the value of your attribute, and thus increase your share.

 - loc 985 - When an upstart from France brought an opposite attribute to the category in the form of a “disposable” razor, Gillette could have laughed and wheeled out its research on how America wants hefty, expensive, high-technology razors. But it didn’t. Instead, Gillette jumped in with a disposable razor of its own, called Good News. By spending heavily, Gillette was able to win the battle of the disposables. Today the Gillette Good News razor dominates the disposable category, which has grown to dominate the razor blade business. Moral: You can’t predict the size of a new attribute’s share, so never laugh.

 - loc 1003 - Law 15: The Law of Candor. When you admit a negative, the prospect will give you a positive.

 - loc 1014 - First and foremost, candor is very disarming. Every negative statement you make about yourself is instantly accepted as truth. Positive statements, on the other hand, are looked at as dubious at best. Especially in an advertisement.

 - loc 1024 - “Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars.” So why go with them? They must try harder. Everybody knew that Avis was second in rent-a-cars. So why go with the obvious? Marketing is often a search for the obvious. Since you can’t change a mind once it’s made up, your marketing efforts have to be devoted to using ideas and concepts already installed in the brain. You have to use your marketing programs to “rub it in.” No program did this as brilliantly as the Avis No. 2 program.

 - loc 1042 - The law of candor must be used carefully and with great skill. First, your “negative” must be widely perceived as a negative. It has to trigger an instant agreement with your prospect’s mind. If the negative doesn’t register quickly, your prospect will be confused and will wonder, “What’s this all about?” Next, you have to shift quickly to the positive. The purpose of candor isn’t to apologize. The purpose of candor is to set up a benefit that will convince your prospect. This law only proves the old maxim: Honesty is the best policy.

 - loc 1048 - Law 16: The Law of Singularity. In each situation, only one move will produce substantial results.

 - loc 1058 - Whether you try hard or try easy, the differences are marginal. Furthermore, the bigger the company, the more the law of averages wipes out any real advantage of a trying-harder approach. History teaches that the only thing that works in marketing is the single, bold stroke. Furthermore, in any given situation there is only one move that will produce substantial results.

 - loc 1107 - Law 17: The Law of Unpredictability. Unless you write your competitors’ plans, you can’t predict the future.

 - loc 1120 - Most of corporate America’s problems are not related to short-term marketing thinking. The problem is short-term financial thinking.

 - loc 1128 - Good short-term planning is coming up with that angle or word that differentiates your product or company. Then you set up a coherent long-term marketing direction that builds a program to maximize that idea or angle. It’s not a long-term plan, it’s a long-term direction. Tom Monaghan’s short-term angle at Domino’s Pizza was to come up with that “home delivery” idea and build a system that delivered pizzas quickly and efficiently. His long-term direction was to build the first nationwide home delivery chain as rapidly as possible.

 - loc 1173 - Law 18: The Law of Success. Success often leads to arrogance, and arrogance to failure.

 - loc 1177 - Ego is the enemy of successful marketing. Objectivity is what’s needed.

 - loc 1185 - Success is often the fatal element behind the rash of line extensions.

 - loc 1192 - The more you identify with your brand or corporate name, the more likely you are to fall into the line extension trap. “It can’t be the name,” you might be thinking when things go wrong. “We have a great name.” Pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall. Proverbs 16:18.

 - loc 1198 - Actually, ego is helpful. It can be an effective driving force in building a business. What hurts is injecting your ego in the marketing process. Brilliant marketers have the ability to think like a prospect thinks. They put themselves in the shoes of their customers. They don’t impose their own view of the world on the situation. (Keep in mind that the world is all perception anyway, and the only thing that counts in marketing is the customer’s perception.)

 - loc 1208 - The bigger the company, the more likely it is that the chief executive has lost touch with the front lines. This might be the single most important factor limiting the growth of a corporation. All other factors favor size. Marketing is war, and the first principle of warfare is the principle of force. The larger army, the larger company, has the advantage.

 - loc 1216 - If you’re a busy CEO, how do you gather objective information on what is really happening? How do you get around the propensity of middle management to tell you what they think you want to hear? How do you get the bad news as well as the good? One possibility is to go “in disguise” or unannounced. This is especially useful at the distributor or retailer level. In many ways this is analogous to the king who dresses up as a commoner and mingles with his subjects. Reason: to get honest opinions of what’s happening.

 - loc 1228 - Marketing is too important to be turned over to an underling. If you delegate anything, you should delegate the chairmanship of the next fund-raising drive. (The vice president of the United States, not the president, attends the state funerals.) The next thing to cut back on are the meetings. Instead of talking things over, walk out and see for yourself. As Gorbachev told Reagan, “It is better to see once than to hear a hundred times.”

 - loc 1234 - Law 19: The Law of Failure. Failure is to be expected and accepted.

 - loc 1241 - The Japanese seem to be able to admit a mistake early and then make the necessary changes. Their consensus management style tends to eliminate the ego. Since a large number of people have a small piece of a big decision, there is no stigma that can be considered career damaging. In other words, it’s a lot easer to live with “We were all wrong” than the devastating “I was wrong.” This egoless approach is a major factor in making the Japanese such relentless marketers. It’s not that they don’t make mistakes, but when they do, they admit them, fix them, and just keep coming.

 - loc 1255 - When the senior executive has a high salary and a short time to retirement, a bold move is highly unlikely. Even junior executives often make “safe” decisions so as to not disrupt their progress up the corporate ladder. Nobody has ever been fired for a bold move they didn’t make.

 - loc 1269 - 20 The Law of Hype The situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the press.

 - loc 1276 - No soft drink has received more hype than New Coke. By one estimate, New Coke received more than $1 billion worth of free publicity. Add to that the hundreds of millions of dollars spent to launch the brand, and New Coke should have been the world’s most successful product. It didn’t happen. Less than 60 days after the launch, Coca-Cola was forced to come back with the original formula, now called Coca-Cola Classic. Today Classic outsells New about 15 to 1.

 - loc 1289 - The essence of the hype was not just that the new product was going to be successful. The essence of the hype was that existing products would now be obsolete. Polyester was going to make wool obsolete. Videotext was going to make newspapers obsolete. The personal helicopter was going to make the roads and highways obsolete.

 - loc 1295 - The office of the future is aptly named—a concept that will remain forever in the future. These predictions violate the law of unpredictability. No one can predict the future, not even a sophisticated reporter for the Wall Street Journal. The only revolutions you can predict are the ones that have already started.

 - loc 1307 - If you’re looking for clues to the future, look in the back of the paper for those innocuous little stories.

 - loc 1332 - Real revolutions don’t arrive at high noon with marching bands and coverage on the 6:00 P.M. news. Real revolutions arrive unannounced in the middle of the night and kind of sneak up on you.

 - loc 1335 - Law 21: The Law of Acceleration. Successful programs are not built on fads, they’re built on trends.

 - loc 1339 - A fad is a wave in the ocean, and a trend is the tide. A fad gets a lot of hype, and a trend gets very little. Like a wave, a fad is very visible, but it goes up and down in a big hurry. Like the tide, a trend is almost invisible, but it’s very powerful over the long term.

 - loc 1344 - (A fashion, on the other hand, is a fad that repeats itself.

 - loc 1352 - Here’s the paradox. If you were faced with a rapidly rising business, with all the characteristics of a fad, the best thing you could do would be to dampen the fad. By dampening the fad, you stretch the fad out and it becomes more like a trend.

 - loc 1367 - Law 22: The Law of Resources. Without adequate funding an idea won’t get off the ground.

 - loc 1374 - Marketing is a game fought in the mind of the prospect. You need money to get into a mind. And you need money to stay in the mind once you get there. You’ll get further with a mediocre idea and a million dollars than with a great idea alone.

 - loc 1381 - Ideas without money are worthless.

 - loc 1419 - What about a rich company? How should it approach the law of resources? The answer is simple: Spend enough. In war, the military always errs on the high side. Do you know how many rations were left after Operation Desert Storm? A lot. So it is in marketing. You can't save your way to success. The more successful marketers front load their investment. In other words, they take no profit for two or three years as the plow all their earnings back into marketing.
