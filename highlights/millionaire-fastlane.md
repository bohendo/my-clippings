#  Millionaire Fastlane
## by MJ DeMarco
---

 - loc 474 - Wealth eludes most people because they are preoccupied with events while disregarding process. Without process, there is no event.

 - loc 527 - Process makes millionaires. Events are by-products of process.

 - loc 677 - Sidewalkers come from all walks of life, even those with the visual embodiments of wealth. They own businesses, they work high-paying careers like medicine or law, or they live as successful actors or musicians and earn big incomes. The common denominator remains consistent: There is no plan, no savings—spend more than you earn and trade a secure tomorrow for a “living large” lifestyle of today.

 - loc 704 - more money is not a solution to poor financial management. Poor money management is like gambling at a casino, because, over time, the house always wins. Tossing more money at the deficiency is like trying to plug a hole in a dam with more water. More money doesn’t buy financial discipline.

 - loc 715 - Wealth is the ability to fully experience life. ~ Henry David Thoreau

 - loc 729 - Wealth is not authored by material possessions, money, or “stuff,” but by what I call the three fundamental “F’s”... Family (relationships) Fitness (health) Freedom (choice) Within this wealth trinity is where you will find true wealth and, yes, happiness.

 - loc 754 - The problem with looking wealthy versus being wealthy is that the former is easy while the latter is not.

 - loc 791 - Wealth is authored by strong familial relationships, fitness and health, and freedom—not by material possessions. Unaffordable material possessions are destructive to the wealth trinity.

 - loc 809 - The fact is, there are many millionaires and well paid career folks who are absolutely miserable, and it has nothing to do with the money. It has to do with their freedom. Money owns them, instead of them owning their money. The well salaried workaholic who is never home to strengthen the relationship with his wife and kids is likely to be less happier than the poor farmer in Thailand who spends half his day tending to his fields and the other half with his family.

 - loc 828 - Money doesn’t buy happiness when it’s misused. Instead of money buying freedom, it buys bondage. “Wealth” and “happiness” are interchangeable, but only if your definition of wealth hasn’t been corrupted by society’s definition. Society says wealth is “stuff,” and because of this faulty definition, the bridge between wealth and happiness collapses.

 - loc 837 - Money secures one agent of the wealth formula, freedom, which is a powerful guardian to wealth’s sibling ingredients: health and relationships.

 - loc 854 - Think about the last time you bought a pack of gum. Did you fret over the price? Did you ask, “Hmmm, can I afford this?” Probably not. You bought the gum and it’s done. The purchase had no impact on your lifestyle or your future choices. To a rich man who walks into a dealership and buys a six-figure Bentley without thought, the acts are the same. Affordability is when you don’t have to think about it. If you have to think about “affordability,” you can’t afford it because affordability carries conditions and consequences. If you buy a boat and resort to mental gymnastics over affordability, YOU CAN’T AFFORD IT.

 - loc 886 - Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions Money doesn’t buy happiness because money is used for consumer pursuits destructive to freedom. Anything destructive to freedom is destructive to the wealth trinity. Money, properly used, can buy freedom, which can lead to happiness. Happiness stems from good health, freedom, and strong interpersonal relationships, not necessarily money. Lifestyle Servitude steals freedom, and what steals freedom, steals wealth. If you think you can afford it, you can’t. The consequence of instant gratification is the destruction of freedom, health, and choice.

 - loc 911 - understand that luck is a product of process, action, work, and being “out there.” And when you are “out there” you stand a chance at being in the right place at the right time.

 - loc 925 - When I think of luck, I think about poker players. Mistakenly, their craft is construed as luck, while career poker players will affirm it isn’t luck, but systematic analytics and player psychology.

 - loc 957 - A Sidewalker’s mindset is anchored in three beliefs that keep them trapped there and vulnerable to moneymaking scams: Belief 1: Luck is needed for wealth. Belief 2: Wealth is an event. Belief 3: Others can give wealth to me.

 - loc 982 - The Law of Victims says you can’t be a victim if you don’t relinquish power to someone capable of making you a victim.

 - loc 1047 - For my friend with the stolen purse, the Fastlane mindset is to take responsibility followed by accountability. Responsibility: It was my fault that my purse was stolen. Accountability: In the future, I will take precautions to ensure it doesn’t happen again.

 - loc 1075 - While the Sidewalk is a chronic lifestyle that mortgages the future for a pleasurable today, the Slowlane is the antithesis: a sacrifice of today in the hopes of a brighter and freer tomorrow.

 - loc 1117 - When a housing crisis erases 40% of your illiquid net worth in one year, the plan fails. The plan is a failure because the plan is based on time and factors you can’t control. Unfortunately, millions of people have faithfully invested decades into the plan only to discover the ugly truth: The Slowlane is risky and insufferably impotent.

 - loc 1182 - Saturday and Sunday is the paycheck for Monday through Friday, and Friday evening symbolizes the emergence of that payment, freedom for two days. The prostitution of Monday through Friday is the reason “Thank God it’s Friday” exists. On Friday, people are paid FREEDOM in the currency of Saturday and Sunday!

 - loc 1183 - The prostitution of Monday through Friday is the reason “Thank God it’s Friday” exists.

 - loc 1271 - I learned more as an entrepreneur in two months than I did working 10 years at dozens of dead-end jobs. The problem with a specialized skill set is, it narrows your useful value to a confined set of marketplace needs.

 - loc 1271 - I learned more as an entrepreneur in two months than I did working 10 years at dozens of dead-end jobs. The problem with a specialized skill set is, it narrows your useful value to a confined set of marketplace needs. You become one of many cogs in a wheel. And if that cog becomes obsolete or expendable? Guess what, you’re out of luck.

 - loc 1277 - After the initial learning experience, the job becomes regimented and accumulation of new knowledge creeps to a crawl. A job limits learning and mutates into life’s death knell: a trade of life force for money.

 - loc 1300 - “Pay yourself first” is a Slowlane doctrine. The problem is that it’s near impossible in a job. Local, state, and federal governments heavily tax earned income and your options to shield that income from taxation is limited to contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs—which are also limited—

 - loc 1373 - A Slowlane guru preaches that a $10,000 investment grown at 15% will be worth over $2.5 million dollars in 40 years!!! Hooray!!! What don’t they tell you? They don’t tell you that a 15% return year-after-year is impossible unless you invest with Bernie Madoff or Charles Ponzi. They don’t tell you that in 40 years you’ll be dead, and if you’re not, you’ll be close. They don’t tell you that in 40 years, your $2.5 million will likely be worth $250,000 in today’s dollars and that a gallon of milk will cost $12.00.

 - loc 1441 - Within the Slowlane, time is mistreated like an effervescent fountain that runs forever. Unfortunately, the mortality rate is 100% and life’s prognosis is death. Some day you will die, and, hopefully, 60% of your time wasn’t squandered in a cubicle while your children grew up and your spouse cheated with the yoga instructor.

 - loc 1466 - The Slowlaner’s natural reaction to the Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL) inherent in their wealth equation is to wage war with intrinsic value by deploying the education weapon. Since ULL defines the Slowlane, the Slowlaner rationalizes that the only variable worthy of escalation is their rate of pay.

 - loc 1470 - The cost of the MBA is $44,000 and 800 hours. Steve justifies this twofold expense (time and money) because he anticipates his intrinsic value to rise. Upon completion, Steve expects to be worth more to his company and worth more in the competitive marketplace. Unfortunately, he still trades his time for money—just at a higher rate, yet still uncontrolled and unleveraged.

 - loc 1493 - My education had the indirect and unintended consequence of restricting my options to specific disciplines based on an educative skill set. The result? Conformity and limited choice. If there aren’t opportunities in my field, my education becomes marginalized and devalued. If the opportunities available require less education(say, a BS) than I have (MBA), I become overqualified and unemployable. If my skills erode in practicality based on technological evolution, my education becomes deprecated and my value to society plummets accordingly.

 - loc 1598 - Many money gurus often suffer from a Paradox of Practice; they teach one wealth equation while getting rich in another. They’re not rich from their own teachings.

 - loc 1678 - The dreary reality is that Slowlane failure doesn’t happen overnight; failure transpires over the years like a termite-infested woodshed, and when its denizens come to judgment, it’s too late.

 - loc 1694 - You can defy the Slowlane’s limitations by becoming so indispensable that your value to society skyrockets. If millions seek you, you will be paid millions. Pro basketball player LeBron James is paid millions because his skills are in short supply. Famous actors and entertainers are paid millions because millions demand their brand in entertainment form. Extreme talent is paid extremely well.

 - loc 1699 - When a corporate CEO cashes $20 million in stock options, you’ve witnessed another Slowlane defiance. Surely you’ve heard about all those overpaid CEOs of large companies raking in the big dough. Have you ever looked at their age? Exclusive of the founders and owners, most of them are in their 50s and 60s. Obviously, the roads through corporate management don’t happen overnight; from mailroom to CEO can take 40 years. And if it does, you certainly don’t get there by taking it easy. Nope, you arrive early and leave late.

 - loc 1734 - Slowlane millionaires have MBAs. Fastlane millionaires hire people with MBAs.

 - loc 1768 - Your own business, self-employment, and entrepreneurship are centrist to the Fastlane, much like a job is to the Slowlane.

 - loc 1793 - Money is everywhere, and it’s extremely abundant. Money is a reflection of how many lives I’ve touched. Money reflects the value I’ve created.

 - loc 1878 - After eight years, Chuma finishes his pyramid at age 26: three years to build the system and five years to reap the benefits of the system. The great pharaoh is pleased and does as promised. He rewards Chuma with kingship and endows him with great riches. Chuma never has to work another day in his life. Meanwhile, Azur continues to dredge away at the same old routine. Lift rocks, waste time and money to get stronger, lift rocks, and get stronger.

 - loc 1890 - In the Slowlane, you are the source of heavy lifting, while in the Fastlane, you construct a system that does it for you.

 - loc 1911 - Applied, this means instead of buying products on TV, sell products. Instead of digging for gold, sell shovels. Instead of taking a class, offer a class. Instead of borrowing money, lend it. Instead of taking a job, hire for jobs. Instead of taking a mortgage, hold a mortgage. Break free from consumption, switch sides, and reorient to the world as producer.

 - loc 1922 - I watch infomercials not to buy, but to see what the pros are doing.

 - loc 1936 - This book effectively transfers the act of income generation from me (the human asset) to the book (the business asset).

 - loc 1951 - Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. ~ TS Eliot

 - loc 1998 - In a survey of 3,000 pentamillionaires ($5 million net worth) the Harrison Group (HarrisonGroupInc.com) reported that almost all pentamillionaires made their fortunes in a big lump sum after a period of years. Worth repeating: a big lump sum, not “by saving 10% of his paycheck for 40 years.”

 - loc 2018 - Any time you have an asset that has sustainable profits, an industry multiplier governed by prevailing market conditions determines the valuation of that asset. Other people or companies will buy that asset based on the asset’s net profit multiplied by the assessed multiple.

 - loc 2018 - Any time you have an asset that has sustainable profits, an industry multiplier governed by prevailing market conditions determines the valuation of that asset. Other people or companies will buy that asset based on the asset’s net profit multiplied by the assessed multiple. For example, if you own a manufacturing company that nets $100,000 and the average multiple for your industry is 6, your asset value is worth $600,000. Industry multipliers are subject to intense negotiating as they rise and fall with the economy and within industry sectors.

 - loc 2080 - If the company you build from scratch has a paper valuation of $60 million and your bank account only has $10,000, are you really a millionaire? Not really. Illiquid, paper-millionaires can’t buy Italian sports cars and palatial estates; money does. And to get the money, you have to increase profit and save it, or go for the big exit: liquidation.

 - loc 2114 - Money trees are business systems that survive on their own. They require periodic support and nurturing but survive on their own, creating a surrogate for your time-for-money trade.

 - loc 2234 - The 5 money-tree seedlings are rental systems, computer systems, content systems, distribution systems, and human-resource systems.

 - loc 2260 - As a lender, you don’t administer the loans; you just sit back and collect checks. It’s super easy and super passive

 - loc 2285 - As I write this, much of my income is derived from non-U.S.-dollar assets in other countries with stronger currencies and better yields. Fastlaners think globally, not locally.

 - loc 2293 - Compound interest pays my bills. It’s my tool. It’s my passive income source. Yet, compound interest is not responsible for my wealth. This is critical. Fastlaners aren’t using compound interest to build wealth, because it’s not in their wealth equation. The heavy lifting of wealth creation is left to their Fastlane business.

 - loc 2322 - A mere 5% interest on $10 million dollars is $40,000 a month in passive income. A saved dollar is the best passive income instrument.

 - loc 2349 - Yes, positivity is favored over cynicism. Belief is the starting point to change. Visualization is crucial. Yes, if you don’t believe you can do it, I’ve got news for you—you can’t. This stuff isn’t new, it’s OLD. While The Law of Attraction is a nice hammer in the toolbox, its flaw is that it ignores the real secret behind wealth, the real secret that transcends all wealth, all people, all cultures, and all roads—and that is the Law of Effection.

 - loc 2353 - The Law of Effection states that the more lives you affect in an entity you control, in scale and/or magnitude, the richer you will become. The shortened, sanitized version is simply: Affect millions and make millions.

 - loc 2363 - To exploit the Law of Effection, your business needs to make an impact of either scale or magnitude, or both. Within our Fastlane wealth equation, “scale” and “magnitude” are implicit to our “net profit” variable. NET PROFIT = Units Sold (Scale) X Unit Profit (Magnitude)

 - loc 2374 - Scale creates millionaires. Magnitude creates millionaires. Scale and magnitude creates billionaires.

 - loc 2420 - If you aren’t familiar with “pay yourself first,” it’s a Slowlane doctrine that urges you to save your money (pay yourself) before all else—food, gas, car payments, and other bills. This supposedly forces the Slowlaner’s savings rate to accelerate their putrid wealth acceleration vehicle: compound interest via market investments.

 - loc 2426 - If your primary income source comes from a job, your ability to pay yourself first is paralyzed because the governments are paid first! For “pay yourself first” to be legitimate, you truly need to pay yourself first in infinite amounts and the government last. You must own your vehicle.

 - loc 2432 - The corporation serves as the Fastlane frame because it offers the immediate tax benefit of “pay yourself first” versus “pay yourself last.” When you own a corporation, net profits are reduced by expenses.

 - loc 2443 - The best business structures for your Fastlane business are: C corporation S corporation Limited liability corporation Each has its advantages and disadvantages, but all share two common benefits: limitation of liability and tax efficiency.

 - loc 2460 - For small startups, I recommend either an LLC or an S corp. Stay away from partnerships and sole-proprietorships, as they do not limit liability.

 - loc 2473 - Your life is the sum result of all the choices you make, both consciously and unconsciously. If you can control the process of choosing, you can take control of all aspects of your life. You can find the freedom that comes from being in charge of yourself. ~ Robert F. Bennett

 - loc 2495 - Determination is not a solitary choice but thousands of them. You cannot decide to be determined; it must occur repeatedly, concertedly, and with commitment.

 - loc 2526 - In reflection, my choice to race was a treasonous choice. Treasonous choices are actions that do irreparable harm to your life, your dreams, and your goals. The consequences of treasonous choices throw life onto unintended detours and hazardous roads that are difficult to escape and oftentimes, permanent.

 - loc 2559 - Our choices have consequences that transcend decades. This transcendence is horsepower. Every day my discomfort reminds me of that fateful day when I chose poorly. And today, I’m still paying the mortgage of that choice, a mortgage that never amortizes.

 - loc 2567 - When your choices are extrapolated throughout the years, the divergence widens. The divergence can be either positive or negative.

 - loc 2575 - Your choices have significant trajectory into the future, and the younger you are, the more horsepower they exude. Unfortunately, horsepower fades with age.

 - loc 2582 - Your life’s choices are like a mature oak tree with millions of branches. The branches symbolize the consequences of your choices. Near the trunk of the tree, the branches are thick, reflecting the decisions you’ve made early in life, while the top branches are thin, symbolizing decisions near the end of your life.

 - loc 2610 - Until we see what we are, we cannot take steps to become what we should be. ~ Charlotte P. Gilman

 - loc 2651 - Your internal language carries weight. If a brain surgeon told you before surgery, “I think I can operate on you and I will try to succeed,” you should freak out

 - loc 2668 - You start making better choices using two strategies dependent on the decision’s gravity. Worse Case Consequence Analysis (WCCA) Weighted Average Decision Matrix (WADM)

 - loc 2673 - WCCA asks you to answer three questions about every decision of consequence: What is the worst-case consequence of this choice? What is the probability of this outcome? Is this an acceptable risk?

 - loc 2697 - For WADM, you need paper and a pencil.

 - loc 2747 - After I crashed my Viper and nearly killed myself, I remember the haze of almost losing everything. I didn’t want to repeat those feelings, and their memories served my future to effect change: Street racing is for morons. Alternatively, I could allow ego to reign, keep street racing, and boast, “I’ll never lose another race again!” While the consequences of our choices can’t be manipulated, you can manipulate your memories to serve you.

 - loc 2759 - Ridicule is the tribute paid to the genius by the mediocrities. ~ Oscar Wilde

 - loc 2818 - Join entrepreneur clubs, attend networking events, ally yourself with like-minders, get yourself around people who subscribe to a Fastlane, anything is-possible mindset, and decide who you want on your team of warriors.

 - loc 2818 - Join entrepreneur clubs, attend networking events, ally yourself with like-minders, get yourself around people who subscribe to a Fastlane, anything is-possible mindset, and decide who you want on your team of warriors. Read books and autobiographies of those who have the kind of success you want. Find a mentor. Join entrepreneur forums with a Fastlane mindset, like the Fastlane Forum!

 - loc 2830 - By talking with other aspiring entrepreneurs, I’ve learned that significant others (husbands, wives, fiancés, girlfriends, boyfriends) can be some of the biggest headwinds out there. Having a life partner who doesn’t ascribe to your life’s ideals and philosophies is like towing a trailer full of wet manure.

 - loc 2848 - A major fast-food restaurant offered a free bucket of chicken to anyone who had an Internet coupon. People flocked to restaurant locations and waited for hours, all for a free $6 bucket of chicken. Know anyone who would stand in line for hours just to get something free?

 - loc 2848 - A major fast-food restaurant offered a free bucket of chicken to anyone who had an Internet coupon. People flocked to restaurant locations and waited for hours, all for a free $6 bucket of chicken. Know anyone who would stand in line for hours just to get something free? Are you one of them?

 - loc 2855 - The greasy chicken truth: Value your time poorly and you will be poor.

 - loc 2876 - The reality is that time is deathly scarce, while money is richly abundant. On any given day, $3 trillion is exchanged in the world currency markets. That’s $3,000,000,000,000. To give that perspective, you can spend a million dollars a day for 8,000 years and you still wouldn’t have spent $3 trillion.

 - loc 2913 - Debt needs a constant drip of blood, and that blood comes from your gas tank of life: time.

 - loc 2952 - Fastlaners exalt time as their primary consideration in decision-making because it’s our most valued asset. Fastlaners are frugal with time, while Slowlaners are frugal with money.

 - loc 2971 - To cease learning at graduation is wealth suicide. Your most effective earning years happen AFTER graduation

 - loc 2982 - The purpose of education within the Fastlane is to amplify the power of the money tree and the business system. You’re not a cog in the wheel; you learn to build the wheel.

 - loc 2996 - it is easier to relent under the weight of “I don’t know how” than it is to actively pursue the knowledge. In today’s information society, there is absolutely no excuse not to find out how.

 - loc 3152 - The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out; the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. The brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough. They are there to stop the other people!

 - loc 3169 - The sweat of success is failure. While you can’t build cardiovascular endurance without sweating, you can’t experience success without failure. Failure is simply a natural response to success. If you avoid failure you will also avoid success.

 - loc 3188 - you amplify your wealth trajectory through time. Intelligent risks have a limited downside, while their upside is unlimited. Moronic risks have a bottomless downside and their upside is limited, or short term.

 - loc 3231 - In my mind I had a forum coming at some point in the undefined future. But this opportunity was not coming at my convenience. Opportunity suddenly turned the corner and I heard its deafening exhaust. Even though I was in the shower, I got out, ran outside soaking wet, unprepared, premature, and met the opportunity. I greeted it, opened the door, and led it inside. Not in my time, but “opportunity’s time,” and someday became today. That decision allowed me to pre-sell hundreds of books before the first word was written.

 - loc 3235 - Many of the world’s successful entrepreneurs started businesses in college. You know their companies: Microsoft, Dell, FedEx, and Facebook. Their founders seized opportunity outside of their timing and chose to take an intelligent risk. These entrepreneurs captured opportunity and didn’t wait for satisfaction of preconditions: “After I graduate” or “On summer break” or “After my Math 202 exam.” Opportunities are dressed as unfilled needs, and when they ring your doorbell, answer it! Unanswered, opportunity leaves and rings another doorbell, knowing eventually, someone willing will answer.

 - loc 3273 - To light the Law of Effection and illuminate your Fastlane road, cross-examine it against the Five Fastlane Commandments (NECST, pronounced “next”). The Commandment of Need The Commandment of Entry The Commandment of Control The Commandment of Scale The Commandment of Time

 - loc 3296 - People care about what your business can do for them. How will it help them? What’s in it for them? Will it solve their problem? Make their life easier? Provide them with shelter? Save them money? Educate them? Make them feel something? Tell me, why on God’s green Earth should I give your business money? What value are you adding to my life?

 - loc 3296 - People care about what your business can do for them. How will it help them? What’s in it for them? Will it solve their problem? Make their life easier? Provide them with shelter? Save them money? Educate them? Make them feel something? Tell me, why on God’s green Earth should I give your business money? What value are you adding to my life? Reflect back to our producer/consumer dichotomy. Consumers are selfish. They demand to know is “what’s in it for me!” To succeed as a producer, surrender your own selfishness and address the selfishness of others.

 - loc 3301 - Stop thinking about business in terms of your selfish desires, whether it’s money, dreams or “do what you love.” Instead, chase needs, problems, pain points, service deficiencies, and emotions.

 - loc 3335 - Money chasers are consumers who haven’t quite made the transition to producer. They want to be producers, but they selfishly think like consumers. For example, in the housing boom, money chasers became mortgage brokers and real estate agents. The burst of the bubble purged the industry clean of the excess.

 - loc 3422 - What is your WHY? Why are you doing this? Why go Fastlane? Whom do you want to prove wrong? My “WHYS” read like this: “I want to pay off my mother’s mortgage.” “I want to wake up without an alarm clock.” “I want to write a book without the pressure of money.” “I want a big house on a mountainside with a pool.” “I want a Lamborghini.” “I want to make a difference.”

 - loc 3503 - The Commandment of Entry states that as entry barriers to any business road fall, or lessen, the effectiveness of that road declines while competition in that field subsequently strengthens.

 - loc 3521 - If you violate the Commandment of Entry, be prepared to be exceptional. Exceptionality breaks the odds of entry. Unfortunately, exceptionality is a long shot, much like an above-average high school athlete going pro.

 - loc 3533 - There’s an old saying, “In a gold rush, don’t dig for gold, sell shovels!” When it comes to entry, your industry and your business should not be available to everyone, because if it is, you must be prepared to be exceptional. And if you are exceptional, easy entry becomes not a liability, but an asset.

 - loc 3548 - When it comes to money, the best warning flag is “everyone.” Everyone is a red flag that the Commandment of Entry has been violated. If everyone is engaged in the same activity, it surely will fail. While “everyone” was buying houses like crazy during the housing boom, I did the opposite. I sat on the sidelines and sold. When the frenzy is buying, you should be selling. When the frenzy is selling, you should be buying or staying pat.

 - loc 3591 - Drivers sell franchises; they don’t buy them. Drivers offer affiliate programs; they don’t join them. Drivers run hedge funds; they don’t invest in them.

 - loc 3613 - Think about the dangers of hitchhiking. You get into some stranger’s car and you let them drive. Hitchhiking a Fastlane is an incredible risk, especially when your family is the cargo.

 - loc 3617 - As the thread progressed, a joke was made about a former bankrupt NBA player, and (long story short) the folks at Google claimed the content violated their terms. My ads were terminated and the revenue stopped. Now imagine if this forum and the Google revenue were responsible for feeding my

 - loc 3617 - As the thread progressed, a joke was made about a former bankrupt NBA player, and (long story short) the folks at Google claimed the content violated their terms. My ads were terminated and the revenue stopped. Now imagine if this forum and the Google revenue were responsible for feeding my family.

 - loc 3662 - When you blindly invest your life and time into someone else’s brand, you become a part of their marketing plan. You become a swab of paint in their big picture.

 - loc 3711 - When your business road violates the Commandment of Scale, wealth acceleration is incarcerated within constricting speed limits. Drive any road with a speed limit of 15 and you aren’t going to get anywhere fast. Scale is about leverage and leverage is what gives the Fastlane wealth equation its power.

 - loc 3817 - Remember this: Owning a business doesn’t guarantee wealth or detachment from time. Some business owners are married to their businesses because their businesses violate the Commandment of Time. The business ostensibly becomes a job and a lifelong prison sentence.

 - loc 3820 - The Commandment of Time asks: Can this business be automated and systematized to operate while I’m absent? Are my margins thick enough to hire human resource seedlings? Can my operation benefit from the introduction of a money tree seedling? How can I get this business to operate exclusive of my time?

 - loc 3873 - Fastlane Purity: Five Commandments Thou shalt not invest in a needless business. Thou shalt not trade time for money. Thou shalt not operate on a limited scale. Thou shalt not relinquish control. Thou shalt not let a business startup be an event over process.

 - loc 3882 - I call the most potent Fastlane roads “The Three I’s,” or “The Three Interstates,” because they possess the fastest upper speed limits and meet, or can meet, all five Fastlane commandments. The three Interstates are: Internet Innovation Intentional Iteration

 - loc 3905 - Lead generation services often provide a service to consumers while simultaneously aggregating a non-homogeneous industry. This is what I did for the limousine industry. I pooled a highly fragmented industry into one centralized source, brought consumers into the mix, and sold that consumer information to limo companies.

 - loc 3939 - the core activity of inventors is just taking something and improving or modifying it. Take something old and stale and make it better. Take an underexposed product, make it your own, and reintroduce it to the world.

 - loc 3968 - Iteration is a profitable, singles-based business scaled to home runs. Franchising is another example of II. If you build a small store with the goal of intentional iteration, your goal isn’t one store, but hundreds, perhaps thousands, through the act of chaining or franchising. The intentional iterator goes into business to cookie-cut his system across many successes. A small store often starts out as a violation of four commandments but can quickly transfigure into a full-fledged Fastlane venture with iteration.

 - loc 3992 - Opportunity is rarely about some blockbuster breakthrough like the light bulb or the car, but as simple as an unmet need, or a need not met adequately. Opportunity is a solution to an inconvenience. Opportunity is simplification. Opportunity is a feeling. Opportunity is comfort. Opportunity is better service. Opportunity is fixing pain. Opportunity is putting weak companies out of business.

 - loc 3996 - “Someone is doing it” is a monumental illusion imposing as an impassable obstacle. Someone is always already doing it. The bigger question is, can you do it better?

 - loc 4169 - Can you figure out the difference between a tax-free yield and a taxable yield? These concepts harden your road to wealth. Financial illiterates can’t manage money systems. To succeed on your roadtrip, you have to know the rules of the road and pass wealth “driver’s education”—basic finance and economics.

 - loc 4174 - Live below your means with the intent to expand your means.

 - loc 4188 - If you can’t critique good advice from bad you don’t have control. For those who hire financial planners, literacy is insurance. Financial advisers do not solve financial illiteracy just as more money doesn’t solve poor money management.

 - loc 4233 - In business, ideas are pawns; they’re 220-mph speedometers on idle, parked Lamborghinis. Actual speed is execution—pressure applied to an accelerator—and it’s the king of the entire game.

 - loc 4249 - I love how idea conjurers protect their ideas with great stewardship, careful to ensure they don’t get into the hands of would be thieves, not knowing that their ideas are already shared by hundreds of others. The owner of an idea is not he who imagines it, but he who executes it.

 - loc 4263 - After my revenue model became successful and copied unmercifully, did my business decline and fail? No, because the idea wasn’t the lynchpin to success, it was execution. Competitors who copied my idea didn’t possess a powerful king to the wealth game, and that is execution. Chess isn’t won by stealing pawns.

 - loc 4267 - Why is execution so difficult, while ideas are so routine? Once again, we return to our wealth dichotomy: Event versus process. Execution takes process: effort, sacrifice, discipline, and persistence. Ideas are just events.

 - loc 4297 - Be prepared for the ultimate business sacrilege: Business plans are useless. Yes, I said it. Business plans are useless because they’re ideas jacked-up on steroids.

 - loc 4302 - The moment you execute, the world will tell you just what I told you: Your business plan is useless. The market (the world) will steer your business in unimaginable places that will violate everything about your business plan. If you interview any entrepreneur who has been in business longer than five years, they’ll tell you that they started off with intention A and ended up at intention B.

 - loc 4323 - As my ideas crystallized into tangible assets that could be consumed by the world, suddenly I became the approachable asset. Venture capitalists and angel investors called me—I didn’t call them. Suddenly, people wanted to see my business plan. Why the sudden change of heart? Wasn’t I the same guy just years earlier? Sure, but instead of an idea on paper, I had a tangible concept that reflected execution.

 - loc 4349 - Complaints are a beautiful thing. They represent free feedback and expose unmet needs in your business.

 - loc 4363 - When you change, there will be complaints. Guaranteed. And yes, not all of them are actionable simply because human psychology is in play, not the integrity of your work.

 - loc 4364 - Complaints of expectation occur when you negatively violate the expectation of your customer. You convince them to do business with you, they expect something, and what you provide doesn’t meet that expectation. This happens because either your service failed or their expectation was malformed by a deceptive marketing strategy. Regardless of which, both expose a problem. And it’s your problem, not the customer’s.

 - loc 4382 - Complaints of void are when your customer continually requests something and you simply don’t have it. Complaints of void are extremely valuable, as they expose unmet needs.

 - loc 4387 - Complaints of void are goldmines of opportunity. People freely tell you exactly what they want and you don’t have to pay for it! Unmet needs are served up on a silver platter.

 - loc 4391 - At the bottom of the barrel are fraudulent complaints. Ask any business owner and they’ll confirm fraudulent complaints are the most disheartening because they reflect the worst of society: Illegitimate complaints designed to exploit the business owner.

 - loc 4405 - Pick your battles. Solve complaints that add the most value while helping the most.

 - loc 4405 - If you try to make everyone happy, you’ll drive yourself nuts. Pick your battles. Solve complaints that add the most value while helping the most.

 - loc 4416 - While bad customer service is frustrating while playing our consumer role, it gives us entrepreneurs a great opportunity. Where customer service lacks unearths great opportunity. You see, the beauty of expectation is that it works in reverse.

 - loc 4419 - You can explode your business into the stratosphere by deploying a customer service strategy that exceeds expectations: I call it SUCS, or “Superior Unexpected Customer Service.”

 - loc 4436 - Customer service that SUCS, service that violates your customer’s low-expectation profile positively, turns customers into lifelong clients, and disciples of your business. They provide a never-ending stream of free advertising. Word of mouth is a powerful advertising tool because it’s FREE and reaps infinite return on investment (ROI).

 - loc 4470 - My repeated, and often preached, motto to my employees was, “The customer pays your paycheck, not me—keep them happy.”

 - loc 4482 - I’m not sure if butchered names from a 1987 gym class serving as employee apparitions was ethical, but the mirage was unexpectedly powerful: My company violated expectations by looking big while acting small.

 - loc 4502 - If an entrepreneur thinks they can’t compete because you’re too big and too well funded, you’ve won before they’ve even started. They either engage half-heartedly or defer to another industry with duller competition. Look big, but act small.

 - loc 4552 - If I didn’t have good team of A’s—accountants and attorneys—I’d be poorer. And yes, these people aren’t easy to find because they’re like partners under contract, another group of individuals who have the keys to your castle.

 - loc 4558 - Be very careful with whom you trust with the keys to your castle because they can drive you to financial ruin. Remember Nicolas Cage; his manager allegedly drove him to the precipice of financial ruin. Investigate and interview. Get referrals from successful, established entrepreneurs.

 - loc 4568 - One of the worst employees I ever hired was a pathological liar who stole from me. Why on earth did I hire her? She disarmed me with words. During the interview process she told me that she sang in the church choir and was a religious woman. While I didn’t ask anything pertaining to religion, she assumed that I assigned honesty to religion. She was right, and it dismantled my defenses. I hired her without verification and it took me several years to uncover the truth. Verify First, Trust Later

 - loc 4610 - Customer service philosophy is irrelevant if employees don’t translate that philosophy into frontline action.

 - loc 4614 - Fanatical customer service—service that SUCS—can help compensate for shortcomings, but fanatical features cannot compensate for poor customer service, or poor human interaction.

 - loc 4636 - People tend to make buying decisions for commoditized goods and services based on one metric: price. If you don’t, it’s because the business has done a good job differentiating its product from the alternatives. If your product doesn’t standout in the crowd, it doesn’t stand a chance and you’re forced into the strategy of “cutting prices to stand out from the crowd.”

 - loc 4663 - most business owners paid more attention to their competition than to their own business. Instead of minding their own business, they had their noses into everything that everyone else was doing. When this happens, you neglect your own product and become reactive instead of proactive.

 - loc 4671 - Forget about your competition 95% of the time. The other 5% should be used to exploit their weaknesses and differentiate your business. If you forget about your competition, you’re forced to focus on your business, which is to innovate and win over the hearts and minds of your customers

 - loc 4719 - The first step at building a brand is to have a Unique Selling Proposition or a USP. As a business without one, you’re adrift in a sea of me-too businesses without a rudder, unmoored to the trade winds of the marketplace. USP-less businesses offer nothing distinct, nothing unique, no benefit, no logical reason that someone should buy from them other than hope or circumstance wrapped around a cheap price. Your USP is the anchor to your brand.

 - loc 4748 - Include your USP on all your public communications: Your trucks, vehicles, and buildings Your advertising and promotional materials Business cards, letterheads, signs, brochures, and flyers Your Web site and your email signature Your voice mail system, receptionist/sales scripts, etc.

 - loc 4769 - There are five ways to get your message above the noise: Polarize Arouse emotions Be risqué Encourage interaction and Be unconventional

 - loc 4775 - Web sites that polarize attract visitors as people defend their cause while others attack it.

 - loc 4868 - Price is a brand-builder because price implies value. The more expensive your price, the higher its perceived value. The cheaper your price, the cheaper its perceived value. Price isn’t simply a number that tells someone what something costs. It conveys value and worth.

 - loc 4918 - A scattered focus leads to scattered results. Instead of one business that thrives, the polygamist-opportunist has 20 businesses that suck.

 - loc 4918 - A scattered focus leads to scattered results. Instead of one business that thrives, the polygamist-opportunist has 20 businesses that suck. Ten businesses earning $10,000 cumulatively are not better than one business that does it singlehandedly. When you segregate your effort among assets, you build weak assets.

 - loc 4928 - Monogamy Leads to Crazy Fun Polygamy! I don’t know any highly successful polygamist-opportunists unless they were monogamous first.
