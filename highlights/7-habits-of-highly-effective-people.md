#  7 Habits of Highly Effective People
## by Stephen Covey

 - loc 925 - Paradigms are inseparable from character. Being is seeing in the human dimension. And what we see is highly interrelated to what we are.

 - loc 1462 - The reflection of the current social paradigm tells us we are largely determined by conditioning and conditions.

 - loc 1465 - Genetic determinism basically says your grandparents did it to you.

 - loc 1468 - Psychic determinism basically says your parents did it to you. Your upbringing, your childhood experience essentially laid out your personal tendencies and your character structure

 - loc 1472 - Environmental determinism basically says your boss is doing it to you—or your spouse, or that bratty teenager, or your economic situation, or national policies. Someone or something in your environment is responsible for your situation.

 - loc 1487 - ashes of those so fated. One day, naked and alone in a small room, he began to become aware of what he later called “the last of the human freedoms”—the freedom his Nazi captors could not take away. They could control his entire environment, they could do what they wanted to his body, but Victor Frankl himself was a self-aware being who could look as an observer at his very involvement. His basic identity was intact. He could decide within himself how all of this was going to affect him.

 - loc 1499 - Between stimulus and response, man has the freedom to choose.

 - loc 1506 - But because of our unique human endowments, we can write new programs for ourselves totally apart from our instincts and training. This is why an animal’s capacity is relatively limited and man’s is unlimited. But if we live like animals, out of our own instincts and conditioning and conditions, out of our collective memory, we too will be limited.

 - loc 1507 - because of our unique human endowments, we can write new programs for ourselves totally apart from our instincts and training.

 - loc 1520 - Look at the word responsibility—“response-ability”—the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility.

 - loc 1520 - Look at the word responsibility—“response-ability”—the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior.

 - loc 1531 - The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person. Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values—carefully thought about, selected and internalized values. Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical, social, or psychological. But their response to the stimuli, conscious or unconscious, is a value-based choice or response.

 - loc 1679 - In the great literature of all progressive societies, love is a verb. Reactive people make it a feeling. They’re driven by feelings.

 - loc 1696 - Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about. The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and magnifying, causing their Circle of Influence to increase. Reactive people, on the other hand, focus their efforts in the Circle of Concern.

 - loc 1718 - Direct control problems are solved by working on our habits. They are obviously within our Circle of Influence. These are the “Private Victories” of Habits 1, 2, and 3.

 - loc 1720 - Indirect control problems are solved by changing our methods of influence. These are the “Public Victories” of Habits 4, 5, and 6.

 - loc 1725 - No control problems involve taking the responsibility to change the line on the bottom on our face—to smile, to genuinely and peacefully accept these problems and learn to live with them, even though we don’t like them.

 - loc 1729 - Whether a problem is direct, indirect, or no control, we have in our hands the first step to the solution. Changing our habits, changing our methods of influence and changing the way we see our no control problems are all within our Circle of Influence.

 - loc 1746 - But one of the executives was proactive. He was driven by values, not feelings. He took the initiative—he anticipated, he empathized, he read the situation. He was not blind to the president’s weaknesses; but instead of criticizing them, he would compensate for them. Where the president was weak in his style, he’d try to buffer his own people and make such weaknesses irrelevant. And he’d work with the president’s strengths—his vision, talent, creativity.

 - loc 1756 - At the next meeting, it was “go for this” and “go for that” to all the executives… but one. To this man, it was “What’s your opinion?” His Circle of Influence had grown.

 - loc 1780 - The Circle of Concern is filled with the have’s: “I’ll be happy when I have my house paid off.” “If only I had a boss who wasn’t such a dictator…”

 - loc 1785 - The Circle of Influence is filled with the be’s—I can be more patient, be wise, be loving. It’s the character focus.

 - loc 1786 - Anytime we think the problem is “out there,” that thought is the problem. We empower what’s out there to control us. The change paradigm is “outside-in”—what’s out there has to change before we can change. The proactive approach is to change from the inside-out: to be different, and by being different, to effect positive change in what’s out there—I can be more resourceful, I can be more diligent, I can be more creative, I can be more cooperative.

 - loc 1824 - For those filled with regret, perhaps the most needful exercise of proactivity is to realize that past mistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concern

 - loc 1828 - The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct and learn from it.

 - loc 1844 - two ways to put ourselves in control of our lives immediately. We can make a promise—and keep it. Or we can set a goal—and work to achieve it. As we make and keep commitments, even small commitments, we begin to establish an inner integrity that gives us the awareness of self-control and the courage and strength to accept more of the responsibility for our own lives.

 - loc 1872 - listen to your language and to the language of the people around you. How often do you use and hear reactive phrases such as “If only,” “I can’t,” or “I have to”?

 - loc 1913 - Although Habit 2 applies to many different circumstances and levels of life, the most fundamental application of “begin with the end in mind” is to begin today with the image, picture, or paradigm of the end of your life as your frame of reference or the criterion by which everything else is examined.

 - loc 1923 - People often find themselves achieving victories that are empty, successes that have come at the expense of things they suddenly realize were far more valuable to them.

 - loc 1936 - “Begin with the end in mind” is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There’s a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation, to all things. Take the construction of a home, for example. You create it in every detail before you ever hammer the first nail into place.
