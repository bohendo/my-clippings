#  Chaos Monkeys
## by Antonio Martinez
---

 - loc 356 - Here was a woman who excelled in the role of gatekeeper and shepherd to difficult and powerful men, whether that role was chief of staff for the prickly US treasury secretary Larry Summers, or COO of and for Zuck. Between her ability to navigate and manage the mercurial and fractious political landscape of a complex organization like Facebook, and her ability to shape messages for Zuck, she was both de facto and de jure the person who ran Facebook Ads. As the debate about the future of Facebook monetization grew more polarized and heated, these meetings would resemble the Supreme Court of Sheryl, the one place where conflicting views could be aired with some hope of resolution.

 - loc 407 - As I observed more than once at Facebook, and as I imagine is the case in all organizations from business to government, high-level decisions that affected thousands of people and billions in revenue would be made on gut feel, the residue of whatever historical politics were in play, and the ability to cater persuasive messages to people either busy, impatient, or uninterested (or all three).

 - loc 617 - To paraphrase the very quotable Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, in the future there will be two types of jobs: people who tell computers what to do, and people who are told by computers what to do.

 - loc 637 - an incumbent in a market dominated by a few, with total information asymmetry, and the ability to make prices on the market rather than just take them, has little incentive to increase transparency.

 - loc 764 - One week into my new Silicon Valley life, and the lesson was this: if you want to be a startup entrepreneur, get used to negotiating from positions of weakness. I’d soon have trickier situations to negotiate than convincing a cop to let me take a cab. And so will you if you play the startup game.

 - loc 775 - Every new form of media initially emulates the forms of the past. The first radio shows were merely people reading books on air, or playing instruments, with no use of clever sound effects or editing. The first TV shows were quiz shows that had originally appeared on radio, with mere headshots of the contestants.

 - loc 861 - The first sign of trouble was an externally visible one, a symptom that any suitably experienced startup practitioner could have detected: nobody from the early days of the company was still around other than Murthy. Every other single cofounder or early employee had left. As Vonnegut wrote in Bluebeard, never trust the survivor of a massacre until you know what he did to survive.

 - loc 864 - As Vonnegut wrote in Bluebeard, never trust the survivor of a massacre until you know what he did to survive.

 - loc 870 - Don’t work for the survivors or architects of massacres. You’ll live just long enough to regret it.

 - loc 883 - An absolutely clear sign of flailing failure is when a company’s quarterly report features a new set of corporate logos, each a breathlessly awaited beta customer who’s just going to blow the doors off usage or revenue in the future.* That’s fine for one quarterly report, but after a year’s worth of an ever-changing list of beta customers, with none morphing into full-on clients with contracts and recurring revenue, you’re chasing a mirage.

 - loc 897 - Here’s the lesson: when the company’s employee retention strategy is cultivating Stockholm syndrome, you’re in the wrong company.

 - loc 927 - That very afternoon, I pulled the classic move you too should use to seduce a potential cofounder into leaving his or her steady-paycheck job. I gave Argyris a physical copy of “How to Start a Startup,” a blog post by Paul Graham, which is the crack-like gateway drug to the startup addiction.

 - loc 946 - Think your idea is worth something? Go and try to sell it, and see what sort of price you’ll get for it. Ideas without implementation, or without an exceptional team to implement them, are like assholes and opinions: everyone’s got one.

 - loc 947 - Ideas without implementation, or without an exceptional team to implement them, are like assholes and opinions: everyone’s got one.

 - loc 949 - Incidentally, the fastest way you can indicate your level of startup naïveté to a VC (or to anybody in tech), is either by claiming you’re in “stealth”—that is, with an idea so secretly valuable you can’t disclose it—or by forcing someone to sign a nondisclosure agreement before you even discuss it. You may as well tattoo LOSER on your forehead instead, to save everyone the trouble. To quote one Valley sage, if your idea is any good, it won’t get stolen, you’ll have to jam it down people’s throats instead.

 - loc 960 - When confronted with any startup idea, ask yourself one simple question: How many miracles have to happen for this to succeed? If the answer is zero, you’re not looking at a startup, you’re just dealing with a regular business like a laundry or a trucking business.

 - loc 960 - When confronted with any startup idea, ask yourself one simple question: How many miracles have to happen for this to succeed? If the answer is zero, you’re not looking at a startup, you’re just dealing with a regular business like a laundry or a trucking business. All you need is capital and minimal execution, and assuming a two-way market, you’ll make some profit. To be a startup, miracles need to happen. But a precise number of miracles. Most successful startups depend on one miracle only.

 - loc 1125 - Jessica had conducted a comprehensive series of interviews of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs for her book Founders at Work, which was a startup anarchist’s cookbook of personal memoir and advice. I had devoured it, and so should you if you want to play in this pond.

 - loc 1189 - Here’s more startup advice: if the drama around your departure from a startup recalls that of a former East German trying to jump the Wall, or Cubans hijacking airliners to Miami, then you should be as ecstatic at leaving as that same East German or Cuban.

 - loc 1200 - One of Mark Twain’s more uplifting quotes maintains that small people always belittle your ambitions, while the great make you feel that you too can be great.

 - loc 1328 - Investors are people with more money than time.       Employees are people with more time than money.       Entrepreneurs are simply the seductive go-betweens.       Startups are business experiments performed with other people’s money.       Marketing is like sex: only losers pay for it.       Company culture is what goes without saying.       There are no real rules, only laws.       Success forgives all sins.       People who leak to you, leak about you.       Meritocracy is the propaganda we use to bless the charade.       Greed and vanity are the twin engines of bourgeois society.       Most managers are incompetent and maintain their jobs via inertia and politics.       Lawsuits are merely expensive feints in a well-scripted conflict narrative between corporate entities.       Capitalism is an amoral farce in which every player—investor, employee, entrepreneur, consumer—is complicit.

 - loc 1452 - We didn’t know it at the time, but nobody would succeed in closing the last-mile gap between Google and the universe of small business; to this day, it’s an unsolved problem. Despite all this techie fix-it boosterism, not every problem has an engineering solution. That doesn’t mean, of course, that you can’t sell one.

 - loc 1498 - The most important decision in a startup, as in life, is picking a partner. It will determine everything that comes after. With the right team, no man or organization can stand against you, and you will ultimately triumph. With the wrong team, you’ll produce internal problems even faster than the external world can, and your inevitable death will effectively be a suicide.

 - loc 1510 - You’ll end up knowing more about your cofounders than their mothers and mates do, given enough time. Consider that when mulling over that work colleague you’re thinking of applying to Y Combinator with.

 - loc 1513 - we were unpracticed morons, and committed the classic error of every first-time startup crew; that is, we divided the equity equally.

 - loc 1526 - Here’s how it needs to be: either you’ve achieved a certain Vulcan-quality mind-meld with your founders, your brains welded together in the crucible of some formative life experience like the military or hard-won work experience, or there’s one guy running the show (with at least 51 percent of the equity). End of story.

 - loc 1560 - Worse, he was apt to get distracted by whatever shiny technobauble came his way, and, as many line engineers do, to expend all-consuming efforts on quashing some single technical bug, or improving some unimportant part of our infrastructure, when those were petty in the overall scheme of things.

 - loc 1583 - People go into startups thinking that the technical problems are the challenges. In practice, the technical stuff is easy, unless you’re incompetent or really at the hairy edge of human knowledge—for example, putting a man on Mars. No, every real problem in startups is a people problem, and as such they’re the hardest to solve, as they often don’t have a real solution, much less a ready software fix.

 - loc 1726 - More symbolically, technology entrepreneurs are society’s chaos monkeys, pulling the plug on everything from taxi medallions (Uber) to traditional hotels (Airbnb) to dating (Tinder). One industry after another is simply knocked out via venture-backed entrepreneurial daring and hastily shipped software. Silicon Valley is the zoo where the chaos monkeys are kept, and their numbers only grow in time. With the explosion of venture capital, there is no shortage of bananas to feed them. The question for society is whether it can survive these entrepreneurial chaos monkeys intact, and at what human cost.

 - loc 1876 - An investor writes you a check for $100,000 to get the startup going. A year later, after hitting some product or usage milestones, you raise $1 million on a $10 million valuation (your typical postseed funding round, referred to as a “series A”). That debt—the original $100,000—converts into equity in the company. Given that the valuation is $10 million, and the investor put in $100,000, he now owns 1 percent of the company. From the point of the view of the investor, this is actually problematic. Say you’re the hot startup of the moment in the midst of a bubble, and you raise on some crazy valuation, such as $100 million. Well, pity our poor angel investor; he gets only 0.1 percent of the company. In essence, the better the company does, the less of it he gets. While he’s guaranteed (in theory) to get a price per share equal to follow-on investors, that’s actually a gross mispricing of his risk, as he put his money in far earlier, when the company was far riskier. Enter the investor’s great friend: the cap. The cap dictates the maximum number at which the company will be valued, for the purposes of calculating the investor’s stake when the company takes more investment capital. In our previous example, say the initial $100,000 investment had been done at a cap of $3 million. Then, despite the company’s raising later at a valuation of $10 million, the angel’s stake amounts to $100,000 ÷ $3 million = 3.3%, a much bigger slice.

 - loc 1891 - Funding a company via equity, rather than debt, is a different beast. With a capped note, there’s no universal agreed-upon value. You can bounce from investor to investor, like a bee from flower to flower gathering pollen, getting notes signed at various caps, and no one need be the wiser. In priced-equity rounds, however, everyone has to agree on a share price and a total amount sold, and everyone must sign on the dotted line at once.

 - loc 1893 - In priced-equity rounds, however, everyone has to agree on a share price and a total amount sold, and everyone must sign on the dotted line at once.

 - loc 2024 - “Tombstones” are the chintzy engraved Lucite bricks used to commemorate a deal in high-stakes American corporate life. On Wall Street, they mark the syndication of some stock or bond deal (an IPO or a bond issue, for example) and decorate, with varying degrees of derision or seriousness, many an investment banker’s desk. In Silicon Valley, the Land of No Sarcasm, they’re taken seriously, and tile the walls of any über-successful VC firm. Thus did the tombstone commemorating the initial $25 million funding round for Google beam forth its rays of divine benediction, like the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico City’s basilica.

 - loc 2086 - I gave him an extended version of our pitch, which he consumed with that look of rapt attention, accompanied by staccato bursts of questions, which was the unmistakable sign of sincere investor interest.

 - loc 2205 - As Sun Tzu informs us, no matter how cowardly by nature, anyone fights to the death when his back is against the wall. A wise combatant always allows his opponent a way out, something Murthy in his maniacal pursuit of us hadn’t provided. Faced with no choice, even the skittish boys would fight to the end, particularly if the actual cost of the fighting, if not the risk of losing, had been passed on to others.

 - loc 2213 - Here is a key insight for any startup: You may think yourself a puny midget among giants when you stride out into a marketplace, and suddenly confront such a giant via litigation or direct competition. But the reality is that larger companies often have much more to fear from you than you from them. For starters, their will to fight is less than yours. Their employees are mercenaries who don’t deeply care, and suffer from the diffuse responsibility and weak emotional investment of a larger organization. What’s an existential struggle to you is merely one more set of tasks to a tuned-out engineer bored of his own product, or another legal hassle to an already overworked legal counsel thinking more about her next stock-vesting date than your suit. Also, large companies have valuable public brands they must delicately preserve, and which can be assailed by even small companies such as yours, particularly in a tight-knit, appearances-conscious ecosystem like that of Silicon Valley. America still loves an underdog, and you’ll be surprised at how many allies come out of the woodwork when some obnoxious incumbent is challenged by a scrappy startup with a convincing story.

 - loc 2224 - Men with nothing to lose will stop at nothing to win.

 - loc 2244 - The lesson here is: if you’re going to be an egomaniacal, sociopathic prick, then do it properly and murder your enemies outright, rather than throw them a bone and expect to kill them later if there is trouble. They might just turn that bone into a weapon.

 - loc 2346 - I told the lawyers that we had raised money and were on the fast track to success, and wouldn’t they want to participate by accepting payment in shares? Then I told the investors that they could invest without fear, as the legal costs were minimal, and in any case the lawyers were accepting shares in lieu of cash. Meanwhile, Argyris and MRM went to the office and coded. Easier joked about than done.

 - loc 2375 - There are worse ways of monetizing sociopathy than startups. If you know better ways, I’m listening.

 - loc 2395 - To quote Balzac, “The secret of great fortunes without apparent cause is a forgotten crime, as the crime was properly done.” Never was a crime better concealed.

 - loc 2395 - To quote Balzac, “The secret of great fortunes without apparent cause is a forgotten crime, as the crime was properly done.”

 - loc 2409 - Steve Jobs was all smoldering ambition, ruthless will to power, and narcissistic amour propre; by all accounts of people who actually worked with him, he was a mediocre engineer who had good taste and knew how to recognize in others talents he didn’t posses, and got them to work like hell for him, while fending off competitors in the meantime. In that sense, he was the absolute exemplar of your successful startup CEO, even if not in the way people commonly think.

 - loc 2425 - In the startup game, there are no real rules, only laws, and weakly enforced ones at that. In the end, success would forgive any sins, as it did for Gates and Jobs, and continues to do for countless startup entrepreneurs.

 - loc 2425 - In the startup game, there are no real rules, only laws, and weakly enforced ones at that. In the end, success would forgive any sins, as it did for Gates and Jobs, and continues to do for countless startup entrepreneurs. Do we begrudge David the use of his sling, after all, against the towering giant Goliath? The Dog Shit Sandwich* Starting a company is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death. —Elon Musk, founder of PayPal, Tesla Motors, and SpaceX OCTOBER 2010 Adchemy was holding a legal gun to our heads.

In the end, success would forgive any sins, as it did for Gates and Jobs, and continues to do for countless startup entrepreneurs. Do we begrudge David the use of his sling, after all, against the towering giant Goliath?

 - loc 2437 - There are two weak points for tech companies, no matter how large: their investors and their potential business partners.

 - loc 2490 - Given Y Combinator’s immense success in drawing the best entrepreneurs, it had a quasi-stranglehold on the best early-stage deal flow in the Valley. And since early-stage deal flow today translated into later-stage deal flow tomorrow, via the follow-on investing phenomena described, Y Combinator was the gatekeeper to the best present and future deals in the Valley.

 - loc 2505 - Y Combinator was the sort of unforgiving power player that remembered the names of investors who had crossed portfolio companies in the past, or who had disseminated unflattering portraits of YC, and blacklisted them from any YC dealings, or from the minds of YC founders.

 - loc 2513 - Finally, an email to me from PG: “Come meet me at home to discuss this on Saturday. Come alone, don’t bring the others, and try to keep them out of it.” Another brief lesson in startups: Whenever you face some stressful, time-consuming, and risky challenge, firewall the rest of the company away from the mess. They’ll likely add no value, and the attendant uncertainty will corrode their productivity when you likely need it most. No matter what happens in the outside world—lawsuit, money issues, the fucking zombie apocalypse—do not let it infect the company’s headspace and become the top item in the internal narrative.

 - loc 2615 - In my limited experience, there are two traits that distinguish successful startup founders at whatever level of the game, from the forgettably minuscule (e.g., AdGrok) to the epoch changing (e.g., SpaceX). First, the ability to monomaniacally and obsessively focus on one thing and one thing only, at the expense of everything else in life.

 - loc 2624 - Second, the ability to take and endure endless amounts of shit. I was raised under the sadistic care of a sister ten years my senior who delighted in unleashing endless taunts and abuses.

 - loc 2641 - Incidentally, it helps to have enemies. While love is a beautiful emotion, far more empires have been built, books written, wrongs righted, fights won, and ambitions realized out of vengeful desire to prove some critic wrong, or existential dread of some perceived enemy, than all the love in the world. Love is grand, but hate and fear last longer.

 - loc 2734 - The height represented how well a startup was doing, and the shape started with a sharp rise from zero, cresting to an apex labeled “Launch!” The peak was followed by a sudden crash and then a low plateau that ran almost the length of the plot. After much flatlining, the curve edged up slightly, before dipping again (label: “misconfigured analytics code”), and then increased at a steady pace until “acquisition.” The big, yawning space between launch peak and gradual takeoff was labeled ominously in large letters: “THE TROUGH OF SORROW.”

 - loc 2766 - Recall our cliché about startups being like building a plane after jumping off a cliff; getting to a positive “run rate,” as it’s called, is like finally getting the wings on, firing the engine, and watching the contraption actually maintain

 - loc 2766 - Recall our cliché about startups being like building a plane after jumping off a cliff; getting to a positive “run rate,” as it’s called, is like finally getting the wings on, firing the engine, and watching the contraption actually maintain or gain altitude (no matter how badly built it may be).

 - loc 2784 - Walking into any meeting, you should know every goddamn thing there is to know about the other person; if you don’t, you’re failing. Quoth Emerson and the intro screen to Mortal Kombat 3: “There is no knowledge that is not power,” and that’s especially true in terms of people. That means a combined Facebook-Twitter-LinkedIn stalk at least. You should have done that on all the players in your space already, incidentally.

 - loc 2792 - Do they have that “lean and hungry look” of Cassius in Julius Caesar, and eat at dingy taquerias, or perhaps live off cheap staples like ramen or food substitutes? Those are the truly dangerous ones, the ones who live like organized crime trigger men, guerrilla fighters, or sailors at sea—eating shitty food and living in cheap, dumpy crash pads—and who couldn’t give a damn about quality of life.* Those are the people to fear, because they don’t need anything an antagonist can deprive them

 - loc 2898 - I was introduced as “a badass” whom they should talk to immediately.

 - loc 2898 - I was introduced as “a badass” whom they should talk to immediately. As I hope I’ve made clear in many disclaimers throughout this work, there was nothing badass about my career in technology. The scant success I had was due purely to happenstance, combined with being a ruthless little shit when it counted. No, I mention this to underline how the snowballing interest of a larger company in a smaller one resembles the intoxicating enchantment one feels for a new romantic interest, house, or car. The target of your interest lays out his or her wares and tries to beguile, but past a certain point, it’s you the buyer who’s seducing yourself into the acquisition. Polite emails with Kevin

The target of your interest lays out his or her wares and tries to beguile, but past a certain point, it’s you the buyer who’s seducing yourself into the acquisition.

 - loc 2986 - What a company builds (SVP, Product), how it builds it (SVP, Engineering), how that eventual product is operationally run (COO), and what other companies it buys (Corp Dev): those are the core functions of any large tech company, and the people from the Ads team we met during forty-eight busy hours in 2011 would, by 2015, be that core leadership of Twitter.

 - loc 3024 - Here’s another lesson for the aspiring startupista: don’t skimp on lawyers. An error at the hour of signing a big contract, or negotiating an acquisition, could easily cost you millions, or be the deciding factor between summers in Ibiza with your model girlfriend or taking a consolation-prize job as product manager at Oracle instead (look, you get pretax commuter cost benefits there!). Get the best legal guns you can pay for, and if you can’t pay for it, convince them to accept something other than money in exchange. Lawyers didn’t get into law because they’re good at business; bamboozle them however so long as they get cracking.

 - loc 3046 - So you see we have two types of mistranslation at work: the intentional kind that serves as diplomatic lubricant to get a deal done, and the more serious kind, which leaves each side thinking it agreed to a different thing. The Silicon Valley world is an almost perfect analogue, and we have deal dragomans of our own.

 - loc 3053 - As a legal note, it’s against the law to record phone calls in California, and such recordings are generally inadmissible in court, save for criminal trials with a warrant. So when the scheming begins, a startup world that does 99.9 percent of its communication via the asynchronous channels of email, messaging, and social media suddenly goes old school, and every communication is conducted via hushed phone call in a closed-door conference room. That’s when you can tell you’re really in some juicy shit; conversely, if you’re still emailing about it, there’s actually nothing real going on.

 - loc 3061 - Now, if this had been Wall Street and had involved public companies, and people such as soon-to-be-acquired startup founders, employees, and investors were engaged in a convoluted game of highly selective telephone, shuffling around inside information with the obvious intent to privately profit (in either actual cash or just influence), we’d all have been hauled off to jail, or at least indicted. But from the get-go, it was clear this was par for the tech course, and nobody batted an eye. Either you talked and played a role in the deal, or you didn’t, because you feared getting fired for breaching confidentiality, but nobody was preaching sermons here either way. And sure as shit, nobody was regulating any of it.

 - loc 3096 - The entire SF startup world, in case you haven’t been keeping track of the geography, lives between First and Eighth Streets, and between King and Market Streets, in SF’s SoMa.

 - loc 3246 - this was his first week at Facebook. A veteran dealmaker

 - loc 3328 - When you get the interview-day invite from whatever admin is managing the logistics, make sure to ask for the interviewer list the day before, so you can do the good librarian’s son homework you should be doing, which is stalking each and every interviewer.

 - loc 3557 - I’d hear an East Coast tech guy perfectly sum up the reigning attitude in Left Coast tech: “It’s like they have no memory there. It’s the Land of the Stateless Machines.”

 - loc 3647 - Remember: if you’re having phone calls, the deal is still on. Phone calls are yesses, emails are nos.

 - loc 3760 - The acquiring company doesn’t care less how money is divided between investors and employees. As we’ve reviewed, what they care about is price per high-value person (that is, engineers and product managers).

 - loc 3767 - founders face a moral choice that’s quite ticklish. They can opt to reward their investors for their investments in time and money, but they’re essentially paying them out of their wallet. The deal is very much a zero-sum game between founders and investors in the final stages.

 - loc 4072 - The company had a seemingly genetic inclination for home-brewing almost every element of its technical stack, using open-source languages or tools occasionally, but then customizing them to the point where they were more Facebook than anything else. Since even seasoned engineers came from a completely different universe, it was necessary to indoctrinate them in the One True Way.

 - loc 4101 - A more illustrative description is “shit umbrella.” If you imagine a bursting monsoon of clumpy diarrhea pouring down like God’s own biblical vengeance, that is more or less where you find yourself in either a startup or a large, high-profile, and complex organization like Facebook. You, my dear product manager, are the communal manservant to your engineering team, holding a large, cumbersome paramerde above their heads bent over keyboards on which they furiously type.

 - loc 4118 - As a Facebook product manager, you resembled an Afghan warlord or a pirate captain: fearsome in appearance to any outsiders, the scourge of entire companies and industries, but actually barely in control of your small band of engineer-hooligans, and always one step from mutiny.

 - loc 4153 - Before 2013, if you wanted to know how Facebook made money, the answer was very simple: a billion times any number is still a big fucking number. Facebook monetization was laughable compared with Google’s on a purely CPM basis. But usage was ungodly. Up there with heroin, carbohydrates, or a weekly paycheck: that’s how addictive and rewarding Facebook was.

 - loc 4238 - By itself, genius can produce original thoughts just as little as a woman by herself can bear children. Outward circumstances must come to fructify genius, and be, as it were, a father to its progeny. —Arthur Schopenhauer, “On Genius,” The Art of Literature

 - loc 4266 - The hacker ethos prevailed above all. This culture is what kept twenty-three-year-old kids who were making half a million a year, in a city where there was lots of fun on offer if you had the cash, tethered to a corporate campus for fourteen-hour days. They ate three meals a day there, sometimes slept there, and did nothing but write code, review code, or comment on new features in internal Facebook groups.

 - loc 4425 - Very few companies have died due to launching early; at worst, you’ll have a onetime product embarrassment (as Apple did with the first version of its iPhone Maps app). However, countless companies have died by losing the nerve to ship, and freezing into a coma of second-guessing, hesitation, and internal indecision. As in life, so in business: maintain a bias for action over inaction.

 - loc 4442 - A metrics dashboard that the entire team fixates on was standard Facebook practice. Those scorecards should obsess the product manager, should be the last thing he thinks of at night and the first thing he thinks of in the morning, and should be known to him, from memory, down to the decimal. Choose well what goes in that line graph, because whatever it is, a good product manager will slave away until it’s going up and to the right, whatever that figure represents.

 - loc 4889 - The story usually ran as follows: the journalist, or one of her “sources,” had seen ads for the San Francisco 49ers after her husband’s cousin’s college roommate posted a photo of himself in a 49ers jersey. Were we using uploaded photos in our ads targeting!!?? This was like being accused of fathering Scarlett Johansson’s love child. I wish I could even reasonably be suspected of pulling that off.

 - loc 4907 - company would have no use for it. Facebook doesn’t sell your data; it buys it. It does this by providing services to advertisers that incentivize them to let Facebook ingest the data you’ve generated outside Facebook. In fact, as we’ll soon see, Facebook is one of the most jealous guardians of user data known to man. It is a black hole of data that can never leave.

 - loc 4908 - Facebook doesn’t sell your data; it buys it. It does this by providing services to advertisers that incentivize them to let Facebook ingest the data you’ve generated outside Facebook. In fact, as we’ll soon see, Facebook is one of the most jealous guardians of user data known to man. It is a black hole of data that can never leave.

 - loc 5014 - Sun did nothing to stem the tide that led to its extinction. When we moved into Menlo Park, there were Sun logos on lots of conference room doors and public spaces. Rather than remove them all, Zuck ordered that a few of them remain. Like corporate memento mori, they were to remind employees that Facebook could also go the way of extinction, and be reduced one day to logos and swag.

 - loc 5086 - coming in as a “successful” startup entrepreneur meant you had lots of starting social capital. Everyone treated me like some champion on a victory lap. But inside, I felt like the survivor of a shipwreck: cold, wet, hands shaking, and a Red Cross blanket thrown over my shoulders, wondering just what the fuck had happened.

 - loc 5100 - If we don’t create the thing that kills Facebook, someone else will. “Embracing change” isn’t enough. It has to be so hardwired into who we are that even talking about it seems redundant. The Internet is not a friendly place. Things that don’t stay relevant don’t even get the luxury of leaving ruins. They disappear.

 - loc 5588 - The key to understanding the somewhat tense Ads-Growth dialectic is this: What makes a user use the product does not necessarily make money, and the reverse is also true. In fact, they’re anticorrelated in general, and you can drive engagement or make money, but not both at once.

 - loc 5638 - The biggest thing going on in marketing right now, what is generating tens of billions of dollars in investment and endless scheming inside the bowels of Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple, is the puzzle of how to tie these different sets of names together, and who controls the links. That’s it. Other than this Game of Thrones power struggle among the great digital powers to control identity, targeting, and attribution, everything else is a parasitic sideshow scarcely worth the hassle of following.

Other than this Game of Thrones power struggle among the great digital powers to control identity, targeting, and attribution, everything else is a parasitic sideshow scarcely worth the hassle of following. Mobile, desktop, and offline: every marketer is chasing after three chimerical and incomplete images of its consumer targets, like a punch-drunk boxer seeing triple and throwing wild haymakers in every direction. But behind it all there’s a single person: a nervous ball of needs, wants, and anxieties, whose species evolved in a Paleolithic world of toothy predators and the hunter-gatherer feast-famine duality, and who is presently confronted, a mere blip of time later, with an endless feast of blinking lights and hyperoptimized stimuli. Can you blame the poor beasts for clicking themselves to death with Candy Crush Saga, or maniacally (and frictionlessly) squandering resources they don’t have on things they don’t need? The real unmet challenge here is reconciling all those various names for that one fidgety brain.

 - loc 5659 - The revenue from that sale (whether online or in the physical store) is credited toward the mobile media ad impression the advertiser paid for. Thanks to this identity bridge between all devices, advertisers know exactly what paid media influenced you to consume. The ad server, the company that actually showed you the ad on that mobile game you were playing, understands exactly which set of flashing pixels, the most virtual thing in the world, made you spend cold, hard cash. Suddenly, that mobile ad impression the games publisher sold you becomes that much more valuable.

 - loc 5668 - the role of modern-day Big Brother is actually played by companies you’ve likely never heard about. Companies with names like Axciom, Experian, Epsilon, Merkle, and Neustar (among others). These are the companies that since the dawn of the direct-marketing age in the sixties and seventies have been tracking all of consumer America. They know your name, address, phone number, email address, education level, rough income, who else is in your household and their ages and spending patterns, and which consumer segment you fit into—and they’ve been accumulating this information since before the Internet even existed.

 - loc 6071 - they cling to identities, clusters of consumption patterns, that

 - loc 6178 - Here is your lesson from the Facebook IPO: whenever you see the headline “Stock X Pops on First Day of Trading and Declared a Success,” instead think “Founders and employees just got completely screwed, and the bankers and their wealthy clients made fortunes.” Because that’s what happened, and didn’t happen, in the case of Facebook.

 - loc 6506 - family, the Facebook hoi polloi friended or followed whomever they could among the Facebook nobility, and watched, nose pressed against the glass, the regal extravaganza unfold. One of those princes, first among equals, was Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Zuck’s former teaching assistant at Harvard. Purportedly raised on a horse ranch in Northern California, he was a big, bald bully with tattoos on both arms, a former member of the Harvard tae kwon do team grown thick with age. Prior to his involvement in Ads, he was the engineering brains behind the initial versions of News Feed, a fact he’d never fail to mention on a first meeting. He was the first Friend of Zuck to work in Ads, and it was understood he had been dispatched to unfuck the Ads team from the maelstrom of directionless chaos under Badros and Gokul. In that sense, Boz was an absolute godsend, and the Ads team, not to mention Facebook’s finances, has reaped the benefit of his decisive authority ever since he assumed the reins. As I hope I’ve managed to detail, from 2011 until early 2013, the Facebook monetization strategy distinguished itself mostly by its complete absence (other than the failed Sponsored Stories experiment). As with the British schoolchildren in William

 - loc 6889 - There were few women one would call conventionally attractive at Facebook. The few there were rarely if ever dressed for work with their femininity on display in the form of dresses and heels. A fully turned out member of the deuxième sexe in a conference room was as clear an angel of death as a short-barreled .38 Special revolver.
